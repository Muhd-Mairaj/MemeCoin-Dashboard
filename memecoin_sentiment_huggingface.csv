2025-06-05 04:21:52,Reddit,dogecoin,"Beyond the Clouds: My Pilgrimage to the Doge Monastery, Hidden in the Himalayas! Such Wow Hey Shibes! Just had to share this incredible experience. I've been on a bit of an adventure, tracing whispers and rumors of a legendary place, and today, I found it. Nestled deep within an uncharted valley in the Himalayas, a place so remote even Google Maps shrugs, stands the **Doge Monastery**.

Seriously, this place is something else. As you can see from the pic, it's a magnificent golden temple dedicated to... well, *him*. The energy here is palpable. Everyone is so friendly, connected by a shared belief in the Doge, and the whole atmosphere is just incredibly serene. They even have these giant, glowing Doge coin symbols everywhere!

I spent the day meditating (or trying to, with such a view!), sharing stories with other pilgrims from all corners of the globe, and even got to witness a ceremonial offering of golden Doge coins (don't worry, they're not real crypto, just symbolic tokens!). The wise monks here teach principles of kindness, community, and, of course, ""Do Only Good Everyday.""

It's truly a place of peace and reflection, far removed from the daily FUD and market fluctuations. If you ever get the chance to embark on such a journey, I highly recommend it. Though, fair warning, the trek up here is no joke! Took me days and a lot of determination.

Much respect to the Doge and this amazing community. To the moon, from the roof of the world! 🚀🌕

→ If DOGE is integrated for tipping & microtransactions, we could be seeing $1.00–$1.50+ DOGE

Trump is fully backing crypto
→ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, pro-crypto stance, institutional confidence rising

→ Market-wide bull run incoming

DOGE is stable around $0.22 right now
→ Low entry, high upside if adoption hits

2025-06-04 20:12:56,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Today, we're getting an interesting mix of signals from ‘Smart Money’, so moving through the Indicators provides a clearer picture of what we can expect. Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ is profit-taking at strategic levels, which holds the market at Oversold near Neutral, while they hold balanced control over the market, pacing alongside Sell pressure over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that prices are WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are contracted even further, which means we have a Consolidation phase with underlying breakout pressure. ADX values reveal Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This shows that the market is underperforming compared to historical averages, lacking ‘Price Action’, and is attempting to stabilize the price near the Short term EMA levels. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility falling further to the LOWEST end of our norms range. Price movements are holding AT the LOW Volatility Bands while respecting their Support/Resistance channels, indicating that a LOW Volatility Support test has occurred.

Volume Indicators highlight reduced participation in the Short term, while money flow moved to Oversold. A closer look reveals that ‘Smart Money’ is clearly matching any Sell pressure, as money flow implies that only barely more money is being moved out of the market by triggered Sell pressure and profit-taking compared to what Buyers are moving in. Sentiment Indicators signal a Strong level of distribution that has pulled the market into an emerging new Short term negative Trend cycle. This was finally enough to pull the market out of its Long term positive Trend cycle and extend the negative Trend cycle from Short into Long term, as seen by the negative PVT value. News articles remain Bullish, showing technical setups, burn rates, and price forecasts for gains, all aimed at alleviating FUD/FOMO while still continuing the Utility narrative. News is collectively dedicated to building confidence lately by staying focused on ecosystem upgrades and on-chain fundamentals.

I see a picture in my mind of a dapper old man with a fixed destination who keeps stopping to catch his breath, holding onto his memory of the path ahead, which creates a level of caution as he paces himself. In other words, the market seems to be in a transient Consolidation phase and, when I overlay $SPY, it appears that the environment is inverse, yet, less fearful. Encouragingly, this will support price stability and provide a solid position WITHIN our market structure. Based on this, my expectation is that we will move up over the next few days to weeks toward around the $0.00001400ish level. This aligns with multiple insights: the market is in the ‘Demand Zone’, at the bottom of the ‘Premium Zone’, meaning it is a ‘Discount Zone’ right now. All of this is occurring at the tail end of a Long term dynamic structure, and from here we need to see if Buyers will step in to help defend Neutral levels or if Sell pressure through Short term profit-taking, leads us into an extended Consolidation. Based on the current setup, I am expecting an Uptrend scenario because we are already seeing the price swing through a tight trading range. This is basically a cause and effect from ‘Smart Money’ accumulation and distribution as they attempt to absorb liquidity and create demand as a way to confirm that the market is stable enough to support a Strong ‘Markup’ phase. Even though it is tedious, it works in our Long term favor overall because when the market does take off, those few largest SHIB holders will determine how far the price rises rather than FUD/FOMO triggering a mass Sell-off.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone while doing a Short term test bounce off the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the market can only fail to the firmly established Long term CRITICAL Support price at $0.00001220, and that is our ABSOLUTE BOTTOM. At MAX, the price will test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001370.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-06-03 19:12:32,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like ‘Smart Money’ was able to use Short Consolidations to catch its breath and finally convert our ‘Demand Zone’ into an institutional ‘Premium Zone’. Momentum Indicators highlight the strategic increase in Buy pressure over multiple time frames, holding the market in a Bullish, stable position ABOVE Neutral. Trend Indicators reveal the price placing pressure on the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud, occasionally holding ABOVE it. Bollinger Bands are squeezed in a tight range, which means the market has underlying breakout pressure building alongside a stable Uptrend. ADX values signal Average Trend strength holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while attempting to recapture the 200-Day EMA and revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility at the LOW of our norms range. Price movements are AT or ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, further supporting the outlook of a Bullish Uptrend with underlying breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators show increased participation off the bounce while money flow has entered a Neutral state. A closer look at CMF reveals that Buyers are moving substantially more money into the market at strategic levels to absorb any remaining Sell pressure. Sentiment Indicators show that this Strong level of strategic accumulation from ‘Smart Money’ has shifted the market into a Short term positive Trend cycle. This is encouraging, as it adds strength to the Long term positive Trend cycle, seen by the elevated PVT value. News articles show technical setups, burn initiatives, and ecosystem updates, all of which help alleviate FUD/FOMO while continuing a narrative that highlights SHIB as a Utility. News combines some Bullish catalysts and Short term Volatility cautions as a way to build confidence and shift attention toward Long term fundamentals. This offers great insight into our institutional support and awareness.

‘Smart Money’ is taking a tactical pause, and this window of demand lets reaccumulation absorb Sell pressure without forcing the price to overextend. It really shows how comfortable the market has become as we settle in the ‘Demand Zone’, which at an institutional level has become a ‘Premium Zone’. We are already seeing increasing Volume off our bounces from the Neutral of my algorithm’s price range. That tells us institutions are actively accumulating, which should stage the ‘Markup’ phase quite well. We need to focus on persistent Consolidations, because those will give us greater insight and a timeline into whether we are heading towards a drawn out ‘Base Building’ or the next big breakout leading to ‘Markup’. Basically, the market is already building strength, so we will either break out or run through an extended Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price still holds WITHIN the Neutral zone, just ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001310, which constitutes the TOP of our Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001430. At LOWEST, prices will reach down and bounce off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001250.

2025-06-02 23:40:24,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our current accumulation structure shows the ‘Demand Zone’ being used as a rest stop for ‘Smart Money’ to take a Short pause to ensure they aren’t overpaying. Momentum Indicators reveal a Neutral ground where ‘Smart Money’ has taken control across multiple time frames through strategic price stabilization. Trend Indicators signal prices ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are contracting further, highlighting an Uptrend with underlying breakout pressure. ADX values show Average Trend strength holds prices ABOVE the Supertrend and all Short term EMAs while prices attempt to recover the 200-Day EMA. This reveals price stabilization and efforts to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the breakout signal from the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range. Price movements hold ABOVE the Volatility Bands, signaling that the market is beginning to test Resistance ranges.

Volume Indicators highlight a slight reduction in participation, with money flow hovering just ABOVE Oversold. A closer look at CMF reveals a near flip from yesterday, meaning that ‘Smart Money’ is profit taking. Sentiment Indicators show Strong distribution, yet this only led the market into a Neutral Short term Trend cycle while preserving the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient PVT value. News remains focused on alleviating FUD/FOMO while reinforcing the Utility narrative through DAO ecosystem updates, burn rates, and technical setups that support price appreciation. Only a few articles cover Short term Volatility; most cover Long term fundamentals now.

Looking at $VIX, I see it dropped further today, which means we will have less fear and should see less Volatility with bolstered Sentiment. At this stage, it feels like the market is taking a breath before attempting its next move. We are watching a balancing act of cautious Buyers and Sellers IN the ‘Demand Zone’. This ‘High Noon’ could lead to a drawn-out Consolidation or the start of an Uptrend cycle. I already see Volume increasing off our bounces, so the deciding factor is whether Sell pressure can taper off, which would allow us to break out.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate prices are AT the TOP of our Neutral zone, resting just ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001310. At MAX, prices will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level pivot point at $0.00001430. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001250.

Just a personal note: I have accomplished so many amazing things and I am very thankful. I am going to undertake the next adventure of my life. Today I completed the first stages of enlisting in the United States Army. Being a father, a husband, earning new experiences and helping others are my passions. At the one-year mark of this analysis, I will end this process and transition into the next chapter of my life. In the meantime, I will keep working on finishing my investing book and helping anyone I can. Embody what SHIB can be! 34 years old and life is…

2025-06-01 20:16:14,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Again we saw that the world still keeps rushing to the store to buy out all the toilet paper. This is a deep statement upon which this entire analysis process has been built. “Sentiment is KING”. Momentum Indicators reveal ‘Smart Money’ absorbing the supply at strategic levels over multiple time frames, stabilizing the market into a Bullish zone to establish a counterbalance to Sell pressure without triggering Volatility in either direction. Trend Indicators show prices WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, signaling that breakout pressure is building. ADX values highlight Average yet increasing Trend strength, holding price ABOVE the Supertrend and moving through our EMA averages now approaching the 50-Day. The market still remains BELOW the 200-Day EMA, which means it is attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’ but is currently focused on stabilization. Volatility Indicators confirm that breakout pressure is building, with Volatility returning to the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are pressing against the Volatility HIGH Bands while respecting their Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators show increasing participation in the Short term, indicating that Buyers are building conviction and lifting the market out of Oversold territory. A closer look at money flow shows that Buyers are moving substantially more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators confirm that this Strong accumulation has begun to cultivate a new Short term positive Trend cycle. All these efforts support the Long term positive Trend cycle and have helped further increase the resilient PVT value. News articles remain dedicated to alleviating FUD/FOMO by outlining on-chain data, whale accumulations, burn rates, technical breakout patterns and upgrades to the ecosystem such as ShibDAO. All of these reports support the narrative of a Utility asset! The news balances Bullish coverage by highlighting sell-offs, channel breakdowns and Support tests, as a way to explain Short term volatility as a part of the path to utilization.

Everything looks like we have genuine demand. The fact that we are already seeing a staircase of higher LOWS with each pullback stopping just a little higher means that we have a firm base for accumulation. ’Smart Money’ is scaling in right now so they don’t overleverage, and from this point, we need to watch for Momentum to pick up. Once we see Buyer conviction expand through Volume, we’ll begin making some bigger moves that could trigger ‘Markup’. Either way, when the VIX begins falling, equity strength piggybacks on Sentiment.
.
Long term Support and Resistances indicate the price still holds WITHIN the Neutral zone, bouncing off the ‘Wall of Support’. At HIGHEST, price will attempt to test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001520. Because the market is already near our CRITICAL Support, we can go NO LOWER than the Long term Support level at $0.00001220.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection sunday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. again we saw that the world still keeps rushing to the store to buy out all the toilet pinvest large amountr. this is a deep statement upon which this entire analysis process has been built. sentiment is king. momentum indicators reveal smart money absorbing the supply at strategic levels over multiple time frames, stabilizing the market into a optimistic zone to establish a counterbalance to sell pressure without triggering volatility in either direction. trend indicators show prices within the ichimoku cloud while bollinger bands are contracting sharply, signaling that breakout pressure is building. adx values highlight average yet increasing trend strength, holding price above the supertrend and moving through our ema averages now approaching the 50day. the market still remains below the 200day ema, which means it is attempting to revitalize price action but is currently focused on stabilization. volatility indicators confirm that breakout pressure is building, with volatility returning to the neutral of our norms range. price movements are pressing against the volatility high bands while respecting their supportresistance channels. volume indicators show increasing participation in the short term, indicating that buyers are building conviction and lifting the market out of oversold territory. a closer look at money flow shows that buyers are moving substantially more money into the market than sellers can move out. sentiment indicators confirm that this strong accumulation has begun to cultivate a new short term positive trend cycle. all these efforts support the long term positive trend cycle and have helped further increase the resilient pvt value. news articles remain dedicated to alleviating fudfear of missing out by outlining onchain data, whale accumulations, burn rates, technical breakout patterns and upgrades to the ecosystem such as shibdao. all of these reports support the narrative of a utility asset! the news balances optimistic coverage by highlighting selloffs, channel breakdowns and support tests, as a way to explain short term volatility as a part of the path to utilization. everything looks like we have genuine demand. the fact that we are already seeing a staircase of higher lows with each pullback stopping just a little higher means that we have a firm base for accumulation. smart money is scaling in right now so they do not overleverage, and from this point, we need to watch for momentum to pick up. once we see buyer conviction expand through volume, well begin making some bigger moves that could trigger markup. either way, when the vix begins falling, equity strength piggybacks on sentiment. . long term support and resistances indicate the price still holds within the neutral zone, bouncing off the wall of support. at highest, price will attempt to test the full range of the wall of resistance up to the 3rdlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001520. because the market is already near our critical support, we can go no lower than the long term support level at 0.001220. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.5766832605004311,POSITIVE
2025-05-31 20:36:28,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Lo, they traverse the labyrinth of folly, concealed from the flame of common sense, and yet their confusion and curiosity become the compass of clarity! Momentum Indicators reveal the aftermath of aggressive Sell pressure, where the market is left beaten up in Oversold territory and Sellers hold control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show the first signs of price stabilization WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding even further, signaling continued Consolidation. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength, both through the Long term Sell and the Short term Buy, creating a balanced Trend that holds the price just BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. The price is attempting to recapture the 12-Day EMA level, signaling the market’s efforts to stabilize and return to average price levels. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands Consolidation with Volatility holding at the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements have recaptured the Volatility Bands’ Support/Resistance channels, further confirming Consolidation.

Volume Indicators show reduced participation, meaning the Sell pressure is beginning to taper off. A detailed look at money flow reveals DEEP Oversold levels, yet Buyers are now moving more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation off a VERY SERIOUS Support level, while remnants of the Sell pressure continue to hold the market in a Short term negative Trend cycle. Another encouraging sign is that our Long term positive Trend cycle remains intact, as seen by the resilient PVT value. News articles have stepped back with Short term Bearish headlines such as whale sell-offs, declining open interest, burn rate concerns and ecosystem updates. These still attempt to ease FUD/FOMO and keep the focus on the Long term Utility narrative and institutional support.

Everything shows the market was stressed, but our Long term CRITICAL Support held, acting as a foundation for a recovery Uptrend. Even with attempts at price stabilization, this is not yet FULL Bullish dominance, but it is not distress either. Investors recognize they overreacted, and now the market is working to establish a balanced state so Buyers can step in. It is an underdog situation; the Trend is broken down in the Short term, yet a swift turnaround is possible. I believe macro fears created overinflated downside headwinds, and once this noise subsides we should see recovery. Staying ABOVE the $0.00001220 Support is an encouraging sign that our foundation remains intact.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate the price holds WITHIN the Neutral zone, where Long/Short term Neutral points are converging in a tight range between the ‘Wall of Support’ and the ‘Wall of Resistance’. At MAX, the market will test the ‘Wall of Resistance’, up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001430. At LOWEST, a break of the CRITICAL Long term Support at $0.00001220 would signify a crash. Today is a critical point; either the market stabilizes and recovers or we see a FULL and potentially unrecoverable breakdown.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-30 19:52:39,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like macro fears are beginning to overwhelm our ‘Reaccumulation’ dynamics, and this has become a critical moment where investors are using cautious risk management to reassess their positions and proceed more defensively while transitioning to Short strategies. Momentum Indicators show the market holding at an Oversold level with aggressive Sell pressure taking control over multiple time frames, as ‘Smart Money’ rushes to rescue their positions from becoming exit liquidity for FUD/FOMO. Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, meaning a Bearish phase, while Bollinger Bands are expanding, which is encouraging because it implies Consolidation of the Bearish Downtrend. ADX values reveal Strong Trend strength holding the price FAR BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels. This shows how much the market is struggling in comparison to both Short/Long term price averages.

Volume Indicators highlight decreasing participation across all time frames, with money flow deep in Oversold territory. A closer look shows that Sellers are moving far more money out of the market than Buyers can move in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong distribution from Sell pressure that is expressing a FULL strength potential, pressing us into a Short term negative Trend cycle rapidly. Another encouraging sign though, is that, despite the signs of ‘Price Shock’, the market is still retaining its position WITHIN a Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient PVT value. News articles cover Bullish technical setups, ecosystem upgrades, and strategic burn rates; these insights are used to ease FUD/FOMO and continue to focus attention on the Utility narrative. Some headlines caution about persistent Short term volatility, but the overall narrative centers on building investor confidence by highlighting fundamental and developmental progress.

The market is testing serious Support levels, and numerically it indicates that we are in DEEP Oversold territory. This sets the stage for a rebound; however, the market is at a critical position due to the overblown macroeconomic shock. So, either we will enter a ‘Distribution’ phase followed by a ‘Markdown’ phase, or the market will realize that it overreacted and we will see signs of supply absorption leading from Oversold conditions that quickly reverse into Bullish recovery. Bitcoin has become a pseudo risk-on play for the tech sector, and it now simply serves as a Sentiment Indicator, which I personally feel undermines “decentralization”, so for now we wait, while my stop-loss remains so tight I could pinch a penny and my accumulation stays nimble enough to hedge back two!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the market is recovering after testing the FULL ‘Wall of Support’. At MAX, the price will attempt to recover the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001430. At LOWEST, the market will attempt another test of the FULL ‘Wall of Support’ and springback pressure could reach the 1-Month LOW at $0.00001230. Any lower would truly signal that the market was not just broken down but that it was broken.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-29 20:24:25,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ would do a hard test of the ‘Demand Zone’ Support, but it still remains in our favor as this stages the rebound while they continue absorbing supply. Momentum Indicators highlight the strategic Neutral ground being held over multiple time frames by ‘Smart Money’ as they continue to absorb anybody who will Sell. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding a little, showing Consolidation; when I put those together, it’s a Consolidation of the Downtrend, meaning a soft landing into Neutral. ADX values show slightly elevated Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend level and all EMAs, signaling ‘Smart Money’s’ control as they hold back ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation of the Downtrend, with Volatility returning to the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are BELOW and WITHIN, fluctuating, the Volatility Bands’ Support/Resistance channels, highlighting the market’s current position in Consolidation.

Volume Indicators reveal extremely strategic participation, holding the market just ABOVE Oversold levels; a closer look at CMF shows that ‘Smart Money’ is moving more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation from ‘Smart Money’, while the combination of Sell pressure and profit-taking at strategic levels led to the emergence of a numeric Short term negative Trend cycle. When compared against the strength added to the Long term positive Trend cycle, this pressure is relatively Neutral, bolstering Long term Trend strength. News articles continue the Utility narrative with coverage of Bullish technical setups, large burn events, and promising accumulation data. These fact-based insights highlight ecosystem advances while noting Short term Volatility as part of a healthy Consolidation phase. This resilient inclination for positive support offers insights into the Strong institutional backing and awareness of Shiba Inu.

From what I can tell, the Weak Bullish Indicator values imply the price is holding near our  ‘Demand Zone’ Support, meaning nothing triggered a FULL breakdown; rather, this still acts as part of a larger process where the market continues to build a solid rebound base. At the institutional level, ‘Smart Money’ is still absorbing supply, showing they want any potential disruptors cleared out of this ‘Markup’ phase. They do not want FUD/FOMO triggered sell-offs; they want stability, and these pullbacks let them ‘Reaccumulate and Reassess’, which is a key part of their strategy. We have a temporary balance between ‘Smart Money’ and Sell pressure, so from here we are still looking for increasing Volume off the bounce and a deeper Buy side near Support. Shallow moves like this, though numerically Bearish, remain part of the transition to ‘Markup’. If you are curious, I cannot recall whether it is called phase D or part D; I use ‘Smart Money Concepts’ and ‘Wyckoff Theory’ in a weird little hybrid system, so I often forget the labels. But this is the tail end of a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase leading into ‘Markup’, so everything is healthy and within expectations.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone where all Long and Short term Neutrals align in a tight range between the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and the ‘Wall of Support’. At MAX, the price will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001520. At LOWEST, the price will bounce off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001380. It makes it very easy to see when Long and Short term averages align, what direction the market has the potential to move through.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-28 20:01:02,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

From what I can see, it looks like our ‘Demand Zone’ is quite healthy, as our Sellers are able to become active and offload their supply into the ‘Demand Zone’ where our Buyers are stepping in. Basically, this creates a numeric Bearish condition without compromising the Uptrend. Momentum Indicators show strategic levels of reaccumulation from ‘Smart Money’ absorbing the Sell pressure, with a mix of profit-taking holding the market just BELOW Neutral, where I would classify it as Weak Bearish leading to Neutral ground. Trend Indicators reveal that prices are just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Sell pressure leading into Consolidation as the price appears to be returning WITHIN the Cloud to Consolidate the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands are even further contracted today, which is an outstanding signal that breakout pressure is imminent. ADX values signal an Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning we're relatively BELOW our average price levels over multiple time frames but are still at a healthy Neutral level, validating the Longer term positive Trend rather than signaling a Trend breakdown. Volatility Indicators further support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range. Price movements are holding just BELOW the Volatility LOW Bands, as price stabilization following the Downtrend looks to Consolidate WITHIN those Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators show a slight decrease in participation for the Short term, while Long term investors reveal a bias for price appreciation over a longer time frame, meaning ‘Smart Money’ has never really let their foot off the pedal in terms of strategic accumulation. Money flow is rising from Oversold levels, and a closer breakdown shows that profit-taking moved more money out of the market than Buyers were moving in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong levels of distribution and signal that the Sell pressure felt by the market was at near MAX strength potential, meaning we may have worked through some of the last of our latest ‘Sell Wall’. Despite the temporary pullback, we can see that the Long term positive Trend cycle remains intact, as the PVT value has stabilized and retains an elevated value. News articles seem to be slightly shifting focus while maintaining a positive bias by covering Bullish technical setups, strategic burn efforts, and evolving ecosystem updates, which are all used to alleviate FUD/FOMO. They appear to reassure investors to concentrate on growing fundamentals surrounding the Utility narrative rather than focus on Short term fluctuations. It's an interesting shift, giving us insights into the level of institutional support and awareness.

Most of the time in ‘Reaccumulation’, the price will linger and move slowly while Buyers and Sellers battle it out; that's essentially the market digesting the dip as a healthy part of an overall Uptrend. It's not unusual for Indicators to swing Bearish while the Trend remains intact, and this is part of the process to lower the cost basis for ‘Smart Money’. You'll see that they're more comfortable with these pullbacks if the underlying Support structure remains solid, as we can see from our ‘Demand Zone’, which creates a level of Strong recovery once they see the Sell pressure begin to weaken. From my multi-time-frame analysis, I can see that we've just about played out the entire ‘Reaccumulation’ structure, and personally I'm just waiting on certain Volume dynamics, like the decrease in Sell pressure during the dips and an increase in Buy Volume when the price starts to bounce. Those will be our signs that the ‘Demand Zone’ is absorbing the supply, which I would consider as my ‘SOS’ signal. As long as we keep seeing tighter bid/ask spreads, with deeper bids on the Buy side of support, we can start to confirm the point at which institutions are becoming more active and the accumulation is beginning to lead into a rebound and the ‘Markup’ phase. You have to be a true analyst to interpret transient Bearish signals in the context of a healthy Consolidation phase. Geez, I think my nerd is showing!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have dipped down with spring-back pressure to the point I estimated yesterday, roughly just ABOVE the 50% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390. We're currently at the LOWEST point, so from here we will want to see the market recapture the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001440. From there, the 1st Target MAX will be to test the TOP of the Short term Neutral range at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH at $0.00001480. This would be like a knock on the ‘Wall of Resistance’, and I could see the market attempting a 2nd Target MAX to test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd‑level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001540.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

It appears that Buyers are showing confidence in the Support structure of the ‘Demand Zone’ as we hover around the Neutral of my algorithm's price range during a Consolidation phase. Momentum Indicators highlight the balance between Buyers and Sellers, while ‘Smart Money’ controls multiple time frames and holds the market in a strategic ‘Demand Zone’. Trend Indicators show that prices are attempting to break ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a preference for an Uptrend following Consolidation. The contraction of the Bollinger Bands further gives weight to the Uptrend outlook while continuing to signal that a breakout is imminent. ADX values continue to reveal Average Trend strength that is slowly intensifying and holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and nearly perfectly at the median of all EMAs. This means that the market has captured healthy Short to Long term average price levels and is attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’ following stabilization. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are attempting to place pressure on the Volatility HIGH Bands while staying WITHIN and respecting the Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators signal increasing participation, which validates the ‘Demand Zone’. A closer look at money flow reveals that Buyers are moving more money into the market than Sellers can move out, creating a strategic Neutral flow. Sentiment Indicators signal a Strong level of accumulation through the ‘Demand Zone’, with participation leading the market into a developing new Short term positive Trend cycle. Participation in this ‘Demand Zone’ has further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the ever-increasing PVT value. News articles present forecast and technical signals that imply incoming substantial gains, breakout opportunities, transformative milestones for the ecosystem, record-breaking burn rates, and ambitious Long term price targets, all of which affirm the Utility narrative and highlight the increasing levels of institutional positive bias and support. These articles were met with a few cautionary headlines that covered declining whale activity and notable Resistance levels; however, they serve to remind investors of the Short term Volatility tied to this asset and help counter FUD/FOMO with fact-based insights to use to manage the Short term risks.

Institutional/‘Smart Money’ loves using ‘Demand Zones’ to recalibrate their positions and reaccumulate, but the fact that the market keeps returning to this zone indicates that there is an underlying Buy power building to test the limits of the Neutral zone, almost as a way to gauge net Sentiment before making any decisive moves. I expect to soon see an eventual burst from the Neutral zone into the ‘Markup’ phase, so these bounces being supported by rising Volume and clean money flow, could be the catalyst we're looking for. Just watch with me for higher LOWS and increasing Volume ABOVE the Neutral zone, because this will confirm that the market is ready for the next Bullish phase. Even though it's a well-structured ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, I get bored, so I'm antsy!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have recaptured the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001410. At MAX, the price is going to attempt to test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001570. At LOWEST, the price will bounce off the TOP of the FULLY tested ‘Wall of Support’, potentially building up intense spring-back pressure all the way down to the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001390.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-26 20:25:12,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like Bulls are finally at the point where they are able to push the market through Short term Resistances, and ‘Smart Money’ is profit-taking with some cautious reaccumulation. Momentum Indicators show the strategic efforts from ‘Smart Money’ over multiple time frames to smooth and stabilize the price into Neutral ground. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT and WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Consolidation following a Resistance test. Bollinger Bands are again contracted further, signaling that breakout pressure is imminent. ADX values reveal Average Trend strength holding the price AT the Supertrend level, with the price sliding BELOW all EMAs. This shows the attempt to stabilize the price, and compared to the Long term, we're relatively healthy as far as Short to Long term averages shown by our EMAs.

Volume Indicators signal increased participation, which is the cautious accumulation from ‘Smart Money’; and looking at our money flow breakdown, we can see that Buyers are moving more money into the market than profit-taking can move out, meaning that this level is a ‘Demand Zone’. Sentiment Indicators highlight increased accumulation at Strong levels to counter any profit-taking or Sell pressure and to smooth and stabilize the market into a Short term Neutral Trend cycle. This healthy underlying strategic pressure has even further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the rising PVT value. News articles covered promising technical breakout reports, expanding ecosystem security verifications, massive token burn rates, and growing support from whale accumulation. These positive insights are only countered with Short term cautions surrounding the technical barriers and signs of reduced inflows, but they are there to help ease FUD/FOMO and allow investors to begin focusing on the evolving Utility narrative and Long term potential, as seen by institutional support.

From what I can tell, it looks like we're seeing some common ‘Reaccumulation’ where our ‘Smart Money’ investors absorb supply at the HIGH and then re-engage at the LOWS, meaning they've kind of “staged” a solid ‘Demand Zone’ for the next Uptrend cycle. Small corrections are healthy, and when you combine that with underlying Bullish Sentiment, it means that investors are ready to continue absorbing Sell pressure for the next move, on the way to ‘Markup’. We just want to see increasing Volume off our bounces and the formation of some higher LOWS from this point to give us the signal that the market is ready to begin intensifying price appreciation. Basically, people that have a lot of money want to know that the wheels aren't going to come off when they get going down the road!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is holding WITHIN the Neutral zone between the ‘Wall of Support’ and ‘Wall Resistance’. At LOWEST, the price will bounce off the firmly tested ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001410. The first thing the market will do is recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500. At MAX, the market will attempt to test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001710.

2025-05-26 05:28:34,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday (LATE) Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Just got in off the road from business trip #3 in 3 days and over 40 hours of work, so let's get it! It's interesting that I got the perspective from not looking at things and then just peeking in. Momentum Indicators show some effects from profit-taking lingering over multiple time frames. ‘Smart Money’ continues to act in our favor, with participation holding the market ABOVE Oversold conditions. Trend Indicators signal that prices are holding WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Consolidation following the Downtrend test bounce. Bollinger Bands are contracted even further, showing that breakout pressure remains imminent. ADX values reveal Average Trend strength, holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Short term EMAs but falling to capture the 200-Day level. This indicates the market is attempting to revitalize and stabilize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding AT the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are holding ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, revealing the beginning of an Uptrend cycle.

Volume Indicators highlight LOW levels of participation during the Short term Downtrend, which is our signal for caution; however, Long term participation remains elevated, indicating that ‘Smart Money’ continues to absorb the supply. Money flow is beginning to increase from Oversold territory, with a detailed look at CMF showing that ‘Smart Money’ is moving more money into the market than profit-taking can move out. Sentiment Indicators show a Strong level of strategic accumulation from ‘Smart Money’ contending against profit-taking, leading to a Neutral Short term cycle. This encouraging supply absorption off the bounce further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increasing PVT value. News articles highlighted their Long term bullish outlook by covering record-breaking token burn rates, breakout patterns, and extremely positive price predictions. They continue the Utility narrative but also covered the Short term risks regarding reduced whale activity and technical resistances. The  fact-based insights help alleviate FUD/FOMO while revealing Long term institutional optimism despite the temporary headwinds.

I feel that taking the break over the past few days has given me an interesting perspective to see the repeating Support/Rejection dynamics confirm a reliable structure where ‘Smart Money’ continues absorbing supply and the demand drives price appreciation from the Support levels. This isn't just a temporary bounce; it appears to be a more aggressive recovery with genuine Bullish intent. That's where I see that this consistent pattern of testing the LOWS and then bouncing to the HIGHS is a textbook example of a market in a solid ‘Reaccumulation’ phase transitioning into ‘Markup’.

Long term Support and Resistance show that the price is holding WITHIN the Short term Neutral zone. At first, the market will attempt to capture the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500. From this position, the price will attempt to test higher levels of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, potentially the FULL range, but first the market will need to hold above the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.0001560, which would constitute the TOP of the Long term Neutral zone. From there, the market will Consolidate the gains; this would be roughly when the price crosses into a defined stall range from the mathematical convergence where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastics are at 70% at $0.00001600, up to the point where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastics are at 80% at $0.00001650. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’, with the 2nd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001350 acting as the TOP of a well-defined stall range that extends all the way down through the remaining bottom part of the ‘Wall of Support’.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

6 more hours of drive time and business trip #2 in 2 days! I just got in off the road, and again, Tulsa roads SUCK! Either way, I missed y'all! Momentum indicators show a strategic pullback; with what appears to be institutional investors testing the market across multiple time frames, leading to some profit-taking. ‘Reaccumulation’ is holding on to Neutral ground. Trend Indicators show the price WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, revealing signs of recovery and price stabilization, while Bollinger Bands are sharply contracted, signaling imminent breakout pressure. ADX values reveal recovering Average Trend strength, holding the price just BELOW the Supertrend and the Long term EMAs. With the price AT the 12-Day EMA, this shows a Consolidation zone where the price will look to strengthen ABOVE the Long term EMAs to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators are supporting the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, signaling solid Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators highlight a slight weakness in participation, but Long term reveals strategic ‘Reaccumulation’ attempts from ‘Smart Money’. Looking at our money flow signals recovery from Oversold conditions, with a closer look revealing that profit-taking moved just a little bit more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ could move in. Sentiment Indicators show increasing levels of accumulation off the bounce, meaning that this Support level is holding and has become a healthy point for Buyers to absorb the supply from the ‘Sell Wall’. This profit-taking only managed to cultivate a very Weak Short term negative Trend cycle, while overall ‘Smart Money’ continues to strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles held a Long term Bullish narrative driven by reports of record token burns, technical breakout projections, and strategic ecosystem updates. The articles continue with the Utility narrative while there were Short term highlights of technical signals showing increasing Volatility, but overall these insights help ease FUD/FOMO while revealing increasing levels of institutional support and awareness.

This ‘Accumulation/Reaccumulation’ phase shows no signs of breakdown, but the temporary Consolidations are quite disruptive and the resilient order flow from ‘Smart Money’ participation seems to be extending the base of supply absorption through the demand zone. These are increasingly confident bounces showing the formation of higher LOWS, validating the Uptrend structure. What we're waiting for now is to see a breakout ABOVE the Neutral zone with increasing Volume that will help us identify the transition to ‘Markup’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Short term Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will capture the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500. If we can break ABOVE the Neutral zones, our 1st Target MAX will be to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to around the midsection, just ABOVE the 1st-level Resistance pivot point, where I see this convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastics reaching 70% at $0.00001600. That will act as a stall zone. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390.

2025-05-24 00:17:44,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Arrived home a short while ago from a business trip, and Tulsa roads SUCK! Looks like I missed an underwhelming ‘Reaccumulation’ test, where it appears ‘Smart Money’ was checking on the strength of our previous rally. There are some signs of institutional profit-taking, but investors absorbed quite a bit of the supply around the solid Support rather than triggering a reversal. Momentum Indicators reveal a Weak Neutral ground for the market, with Buyers asserting a Weak level of control over multiple time frames. This implies some profit-taking because if it were a Trend reversal, then Sellers would be in control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show the price is falling BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a position of Consolidation, which is confirmed by looking at the expanded Bollinger Bands as well. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength holding the price WAY BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels. We're not so far BELOW the 200-Day EMA that it signals a breakdown, but that ‘Price Action’ is simply paused. Volatility Indicators give a little bit of a mixed signal, with Volatility remaining elevated, meaning the price will move with greater fluctuation in either direction. With the price being WAY BELOW the Volatility Bands, we can look forward to a potential price stabilization in the Short term, as the healthy basic price dynamic is to move WITHIN those Support/Resistance channels. 

Volume Indicators signal increasing participation on the bounce, which is encouraging as money flow holds at a Neutral level and reveals HIGH levels of money moving out of the market in comparison to the underlying ‘Smart Money’ stabilization. Sentiment Indicators show Strong levels of distribution from profit-taking, which emerges as a very Weak Short term negative Trend cycle, but the ‘Smart Money’ is strategically placing pressure against the market, and this is acting in our favor, as seen by the increased PVT value highlighting a Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles were increasingly Bullish with their coverage of major Shibarium updates and continued the Utility narrative by highlighting whale activity, our HODL investors, and massive token burns. Articles outlined the Short term challenges of prices being BELOW key averages and warned of negative historical Trend behavior during the Q2/Q3 quarters, but these all continue to help calm FUD/FOMO and simply balance optimism.

There is a majority of the Indicators that seem to show that ‘Smart Money’ took some profits and quietly reentered around Support. When you look, you can see that Volume kind of tapered off during the depreciation and began increasing as the price bounced off the LOW, which shows Buyers absorbing supply. The order book shows a deeper Buy side near the Support, which confirms that ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in. I was serious when I urged patience, no FUD/FOMO, and HODL because this is a temporary pullback. Basically, from here we just want to see the Support HOLD and Buy Volume keep increasing. From our current position of Weak Bearish, we want to move to Neutral and then eventually to Bullish territory. As we rise into Bullish territory, that's going to be our signal that the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase is done and that the FULL ‘Markup’ phase is ready to go.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that prices are already bouncing off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 2nd standard price deviation. This should be about the LOWEST point, so I don't see it going any lower, because that ‘Wall of Support’ has been tested THOROUGHLY. At MAX, prices are going to reclaim Neutral ground just BELOW the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH, which acts as the TOP of the Neutral range at $0.00001480. Once we can regain that higher Neutral level, then we're going to move back into Targets and take back our Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection friday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. arrived home a short while ago from a business trip, and tulsa roads suck! looks like i missed an underwhelming reaccumulation test, where it appears smart money was checking on the strength of our previous rally. there are some signs of institutional profittaking, but investors absorbed quite a bit of the supply around the solid support rather than triggering a reversal. momentum indicators reveal a weak neutral ground for the market, with buyers asserting a weak level of control over multiple time frames. this implies some profittaking because if it were a trend reversal, then sellers would be in control of the market over multiple time frames. trend indicators show the price is falling below the ichimoku cloud, signaling a position of consolidation, which is confirmed by looking at the expanded bollinger bands as well. adx values highlight average trend strength holding the price way below the supertrend and all ema levels. were not so far below the 200day ema that it signals a breakdown, but that price action is simply paused. volatility indicators give a little bit of a mixed signal, with volatility remaining elevated, meaning the price will move with greater fluctuation in either direction. with the price being way below the volatility bands, we can look forward to a potential price stabilization in the short term, as the healthy basic price dynamic is to move within those supportresistance channels. volume indicators signal increasing participation on the bounce, which is encouraging as money flow holds at a neutral level and reveals high levels of money moving out of the market in comparison to the underlying smart money stabilization. sentiment indicators show strong levels of distribution from profittaking, which emerges as a very weak short term negative trend cycle, but the smart money is strategically placing pressure against the market, and this is acting in our favor, as seen by the increased pvt value highlighting a long term positive trend cycle. news articles were increasingly optimistic with their coverage of major shibarium updates and continued the utility narrative by highlighting whale activity, our hold investors, and massive token burns. articles outlined the short term challenges of prices being below key averages and warned of negative historical trend behavior during the q2q3 quarters, but these all continue to help calm fudfear of missing out and simply balance optimism. there is a majority of the indicators that seem to show that smart money took some profits and quietly reentered around support. when you look, you can see that volume kind of tinvest large amountred off during the depreciation and began increasing as the price bounced off the low, which shows buyers absorbing supply. the order book shows a deeper buy side near the support, which confirms that smart money is stepping in. i was serious when i urged patience, no fudfear of missing out, and hold because this is a temporary pullback. basically, from here we just want to see the support hold and buy volume keep increasing. from our current position of weak pessimistic, we want to move to neutral and then eventually to optimistic territory. as we rise into optimistic territory, that is going to be our signal that the reaccumulation phase is done and that the full markup phase is ready to go. long term support and resistances indicate that prices are already bouncing off the top of the wall of support at the 2nd standard price deviation. this should be about the lowest point, so i do not see it going any lower, because that wall of support has been tested thoroughly. at max, prices are going to reclaim neutral ground just below the wall of resistance at the 38.2 retracement of the 13week high, which acts as the top of the neutral range at 0.001480. once we can regain that higher neutral level, then were going to move back into targets and take back our long term neutral major pivot point at 0.001500. from there, optimistic territory would put us at 1st target max at nearly the top test of the wall of resistance at the 2ndlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001650. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",-0.30377568304538727,NEGATIVE

2025-05-22 21:00:25,Reddit,shiba,"ANTI FUD/FOMO Analysis - Context and Expectations (POST ATTEMPT #2) This is my forward-looking analysis of the current Trend cycle, using my methodologies to provide a basis of understanding and set expectations that can give the SHIBArmy insight into our investment. Other cryptos have their unique community caveats, but SHIB will have the WISEST investors! We’re in this together….so let’s look at it the same way, together!

Recently, I covered the current market using part of my technical and fundamental methodologies to clarify this asset’s movements, which, in my earnest opinion, have become textbook examples. I plan to save these analyses and charts for the rest of my life. So far, we have identified the dynamic cycle as the “Reaccumulation” phase following a “Base Building” phase. I have conducted a Long term analysis and justified a price range of $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 by the end of June. We now need to further clarify the market’s movements because simply labeling each day as “Consolidation” can be misleading without context. In line with my analysis findings, I will explain how the market should behave within that price range and how long that behavior might persist.

I love Fibonacci Retracements because they provide immediate context when I look at the charts; they reveal where the market is and what it can do. Currently, we are resting just below the 23.6% retracement level of our ATH.

https://preview.redd.it/1vdc5js3de2f1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=6835d47182c1f2508e46e7db4eb956e4f187aff5

Looking at the MONTHLY view, we find ourselves in a familiar position that we can use for reference. Let’s move into Short time frames. The previous “Reaccumulation” appears to be around September of 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/rdaxv6h5de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae0a1c6e5a88621dccbde918c94d0e3cece3304

We seem to be in a similar position as that September 2024 phase, so we need to gauge how long this dynamic should play out.

https://preview.redd.it/dyhgj087de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=f895f1cf94b3ed4c3f2fe24b15daf338e7a27b1f

I estimate roughly 65 days (about two months) for a “Reaccumulation” phase before the “Markup” phase begins. Let’s take a closer look at that previous ‘Reaccumulation’. From my view, it occurred between the 23.6% and the 38.2% retracement levels. Now I have context and clearer expectations.

https://preview.redd.it/m9n812n8de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=31785ebbd1067e8e13f093fe500a203a0434e481

Where were the price movements? Well, from this view I can see that the ‘Reaccumulation’ occurred WITHIN the 23.6% and the 38.2% retracement levels. That’s context and expectation.

What is the 23.6% retracement level, you may ask? It is a rapid Support zone where Buyers step in almost immediately to defend the level and drive price appreciation. We see LOW Volatility, as if the market were taking a breather, which appears as Consolidation. Did that happen during the 2024 Reaccumulation? Obviously! Price movements ran sideways and were choppy, ranging from $0.00001370 at the start of the phase to $0.00002160 near the HIGH of building pressure. That Uptrend pushed the price into the ""Decision Zone."" That is where investors take profits and create a solid level of Support WITHIN the range between the 2 retracement levels. Our Support building between the 23.6% and 38.2% levels is special because it aligns in textbook fashion with the ‘Reaccumulation’ dynamics of ‘Smart Money’. Now we have deeper context and expectations. Let’s look at the current cycle’s position.

https://preview.redd.it/cr954m7ade2f1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc067821d31c45de114a25f9091af08ee2a6a56

This chart displays the current dynamic using an overlaid 21-Minute timeframe. Based on this view, I can tell that around June 2, 2025, we should find ourselves above the 23.6% retracement level and expect some Consolidation before establishing a Support level BELOW the 38.2% retracement level, all ahead of the ‘Markup’ phase.

Over the next 2 weeks, build your positions. DO NOT FUD/FOMO; HODL! Remember that SHIB is moving in a defined manner. The more wisdom you have as an investor, the more safety you can apply to your positions. I have provided a timeframe, price ranges, and a detailed breakdown of the current market’s movement dynamics.

If you look at my chart, can you see what I see? In the last cycle, we climbed ABOVE $0.00003100, and I see the market starting to do something quite positive around mid-April 2025. My analysis indicates that across various Indicator classes, all the data points to the same positive alignment.



Hope this helps!

2025-05-22 20:09:20,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This Uptrend cycle was a nice, expected test of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ as the market looks to establish higher Support levels. Momentum Indicators show the sustained effort by ‘Smart Money’ generated demand, which began driving the price over multiple time frames, leading to the market entering a Bullish, positive Support zone. Trend Indicators reveal the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling the beginning of an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are expanding slightly, which gives an early signal for Consolidation of the gains. ADX values signal Average Trend strength holding the price WAY ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMA levels, meaning a Strong level of ‘Price Action’ is currently being retained throughout the market. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH of our Norms range. Price movements are ABOVE and AT the Volatility HIGH Bands, outlining the market's intent for price appreciation to drive the Uptrend cycle and establish higher Supports ABOVE the indicated Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators highlight increasing participation, signaling that demand is increasing, while profit-taking seems to be the main counter to the current Trend. This is revealed in money flow; a closer look shows profit-taking is moving just a little bit more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ can move in. Sentiment Indicators show this Strong level of distribution from profit-taking, while demand and ‘Smart Money’ further cultivated a positive Trend cycle. PVT saw a small decline, which means that profit-taking did weaken the Long term positive Trend cycle slightly, but overall we remain in an elevated position, as seen by the PVT retaining a HIGH value. There is an increased amount of coverage, with News articles showing a Bullish Long term outlook by highlighting charts displaying technical breakouts, record burn rates, and improving community and whale activities. Cautious articles provided fact-based insights around whale sell-offs and seasonal pressure, but the coverage of the Short term risks helps ease FUD/FOMO while also continuing to reinforce the narrative of sustained development toward Utility.

From what I can tell, we have an intact Trend that is beginning to accelerate. This is a textbook sign that the market is beginning to transition from ‘Accumulation’ into ‘Markup’, and that our ‘Smart Money’ investors have just about solidified their positions; Now our Bullish Momentum will be more pronounced. Be aware of any external catalysts, because these will create a LOT of Volatility REALLY FAST and have a major effect on Volume and order flow as we move forward. Increasing Volume off the bounces provides some confidence in the structure, but we need to keep seeing higher LOWS from those bounces, as that's going to be the signal that the base is fully formed and that the ‘Markup’ phase will be sustainable. I just gave a contextual analysis so that when I say ""right now, expect Consolidation,"" you understand that it's not just a Consolidation, but short breaks on the climb up the mountain.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting just BELOW what I would consider the TOP of the NEW Neutral range, which is going to extend from the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001560 down to the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001470. At MAX, the market will continue testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and breach ABOVE it, where the Oversold level for Short term conditions mathematically is when the 14-Day RSI is at 70%, at roughly $0.00001730. At LOWEST, the market is going to bounce off the BOTTOM of the Neutral zone at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001470. The reason I say that is because we've already fully tested the ‘Wall of Support’ and have established demand ABOVE this, so don't anticipate it to fall back, as demand would currently take that as a MAJOR Buy opportunity and we would bounce right back into the Neutral zone.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-21 19:30:28,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The market is contending with some macro catalysts, and we appear to be in a moment of Consolidation. Momentum Indicators show the market's comfort in the ‘Demand Zone’ as Neutral ground, highlighting a solid base being maintained by ‘Smart Money’ over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud near the LOW Band, highlighting the current Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting during this Consolidation phase, signaling increasing breakout pressure and revealing an underlying Uptrend bias. ADX values reveal Average Trend strength, holding the price AT the Supertrend and EMA levels, giving greater definition to the ‘Demand Zone’ and the market's current attempts to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal increasing Volatility, which further supports breakout pressure building, while also showing that any price movements will have greater fluctuation in either direction. Prices are held WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels, further highlighting the solid base of the ‘Demand Zone’.

Volume Indicators show increasing participation through the bounce, and when we look at the breakdown of money flow, we can see that we currently are at a Neutral level, but looking at it in greater detail shows that profit-taking is moving slightly more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ can move in. Sentiment Indicators reveal the distribution levels from profit-taking, attempting to contend with the Short term positive Trend cycle being cultivated by ‘Smart Money’ and extending into a Long term positive Trend cycle that has increased even further despite the recent pullback. News articles offer Bullish reports of technical breakouts, accumulation trends, and forecasts of huge gains. Long term positive bias continues to cultivate the Utility narrative while offering fact-based Short term insights around whale exits, supply barriers, and price dips, but overall the Short term focus is on easing FUD/FOMO while highlighting Long term institutional support.

Investors are sensitive to macro influences, and this is a simple Consolidation and not Trend rejection! Institutional investors are taking a pause and may be offloading some of their positions to kind of reduce their exposure to some of these macroeconomic risks that are coming into focus. Underlying is a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase where Buyers are slowly absorbing the Sell pressure, which keeps the overall Sentiment Bullish. The price bounced off the Neutral zone, showing that the Supports held firm and set the stage for a renewed Uptrend once the market finishes rebalancing.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the ‘Wall of Support’ and ‘Wall of Resistance’ have contracted, tightening the Neutral range where the price currently rests at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001450. At MAX, the price will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001570. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the midway point of the already tested solid ‘Wall of Support’, down to around the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001430.

2025-05-20 19:45:30,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ has successfully established a solid base for a ‘Demand Zone’. Buyers are showing just enough interest to prevent excessive depreciation, but not enough to drive Momentum toward higher prices. Momentum Indicators reveal the strategic Neutral ground being cultivated by ‘Smart Money’ as they absorb supply in ‘Reaccumulation’. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting a Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as yesterday, retaining the signal for breakout pressure underlying the market. ADX values highlight Weak/Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and ALL EMAs, meaning the market is trying to establish a directional bias. Volatility Indicators define the Bollinger Bands by showing falling Volatility, which supports the outlook of Consolidation. However, with Volatility remaining near the HIGH of our norms range, it signals that increasing price movements will occur in either direction. Prices are holding near the LOW Volatility Bands, indicating that the market is attempting to establish Support and remain within the Neutral ‘Demand Zone’.

Volume Indicators show increased participation, yet a closer look at the CMF reveals that profit-taking has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of distribution as Short Sellers attempt to contend with ‘Smart Money’ accumulation. This balance of pressure is driving demand, evidenced by a new positive Trend cycle developing in the Short term and further strengthening the Long term positive Trend cycle, as shown by the increased PVT value. News articles display a resilient positive bias with highlights of technical breakthroughs and large token burns, with several reports hinting at potential reversals and rallies. They also mention Short term risks such as whale liquidations and heavy outflows, but these fact-based insights help ease FUD/FOMO while steering the narrative toward utilization and revealing Long term institutional support.

Even though the price bounces back to our Support levels, this zone of demand shows that there is acceptance at that level, and these bounces only reaffirm how solid the Support is. Accumulation remains intact as institutional buyers continue to participate cautiously while waiting for Buyer conviction to fully kick in. At this point, we are simply waiting to see Strong Volume on the bounce and higher LOWS for confirmation before a sustained Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001460 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001420. At MAX, the price will test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001680. At LOWEST, the price will bounce off the already tested ‘Wall of Support’, potentially down to the midway point near the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001360.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-19 19:45:41,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ continues to absorb the supply while macro catalysts create some temporary Volatility. Momentum Indicators show a slight pullback; however, when I was reviewing the news and conducting on-chain analysis, I tracked some odd whale activity. It appears that a whale may have been ‘Shaken Out’ during ‘Reaccumulation’, which is rather uncommon, or it might have been a rebalancing move to adjust their position. Either way, ‘Smart Money’ acted strategically and secured a Weak level of control over the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is placing pressure on the LOW Band of the Ichimoku Cloud while resting WITHIN the Cloud, reflecting the recent Bearish Consolidation. In the same period, Bollinger Bands expanded, capturing the Consolidation; however, they now appear to be at their peak and are beginning to contract slowly, giving a very early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values show Average Trend strength, holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all Short term EMAs. The market is attempting to capture the Short term EMAs, suggesting an underlying effort to catalyze ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators lend support to the outlook of breakout pressure building, adding greater definition to the mixed signal from the Bollinger Bands. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels, indicating that the market has successfully locked into Neutral ground following the Bearish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators reveal ‘Shakeout’ activity with reduced participation, and Sellers syncing with the odd whale activity, suggesting that retail investors experienced some FUD/FOMO. A detailed view of money flow shows that more money is still flowing into the market than is being removed by profit-taking, confirming that ‘Smart Money’ is successfully absorbing positions. Sentiment Indicators highlight a quick spike in distribution with a Weak negative Trend cycle forming in the Short term. Despite the pullback, the Long term positive Trend cycle remains intact, though weakened. News articles indicate that the market is finding support through technical bounces and increasing burn rates, reinforcing the Utility narrative. Reports cover Short term risks such as declining burn activity and price drops, but these were fact-based insights meant to help ease FUD/FOMO while offering a realistic view of the market's Long term institutional support.

The price continues to respect Support levels and bounces back into the Neutral zone, which is exactly what we hope to see during ‘Reaccumulation’, and this confirms that ‘Smart Money’ is still working in our favor. I anticipate continued ‘Reaccumulation’, and since the market still holds a Weak Bullish strength overall, we will likely see some incremental scaling. This scaling will allow investors to gauge whether the Volatility is transient or the start of a larger macro economic shift.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is bouncing off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to a defined stall range where the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW converges with the mathematical point where the 14-Day RSI is at 50%, at $0.00001390. At MAX, the price will move upward and begin testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-18 19:50:06,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We continue to move through ‘Reaccumulation’ with underlying Bullish Sentiment while testing Support, and ‘Smart Money’ absorbs the supply before the ‘Markup’ phase. Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ is increasing pressure while profit-taking attempts to counteract the Uptrend across multiple time frames, leaving Sellers with very Weak control. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Consolidation, yet the Bollinger Bands are expanding and give an early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values indicate an Average Trend strength holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. As the market fluctuates through the EMA range, we can take it as an attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators are falling, which gives a mixed signal to the Bollinger Bands breakout, meaning that price movements will be relatively stable regardless of direction. Price is holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels while attempting to push ABOVE the HIGH Bands, further supporting the outlook of building breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators signal an encouraging uptick in participation over both the Short and Long term as the price bounces off the Support area we’ve identified over the past few days. Money flow displays elevated strength from ‘Smart Money’ absorbing the supply through ‘Reaccumulation’; a detailed look shows that exponentially more money is flowing into the market than profit-taking can remove. Sentiment Indicators reveal elevated levels of Strong accumulation by ‘Smart Money’, nearly expressing a FULL strength potential. This elevated accumulation further strengthened the Long term Trend cycle, as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles are shifting focus to the Short term market by highlighting positive support from Bullish technical signals, price predictions sounding like the 2021 rally, and a potential SHIB ETF listing that also continues to support the Long term narrative of the move from MEME to Utility. Although some stories caution about LOW burn activity and a sluggish overall crypto market, the fact-based insights help ease FUD/FOMO while providing a realistic view of market conditions. Institutional support remains positive.

From what we have seen over the past few days, our most recent LOW was marked by a ‘Three Black Crows’ candlestick pattern followed by a ‘Hanging Man’ at the BOTTOM of the Downtrend, serving as the visualization of the profit-taking. When I take this with our overall dynamic cycle, it is clear that our LOW highlighted the accumulation zone that ‘Smart Money’ and institutions cultivated. They are absorbing supply while allowing the price to rebound, effectively defending the latest Support level as they build larger positions. This is a clear sign that accumulation is transitioning into an early ‘Markup’ dynamic, as demand is starting to drive the price through less pressured Resistance tests. When the price visits the Support zone, it acts like a healthy little ‘Shakeout’. Retests allow for ‘Reaccumulation’, and the fact that the price falls only to the TOP of the Support averages means we have a cushion. Pullbacks are some of the last opportunities to add to your positions, so follow this ‘Smart Money’ dynamic to make sure you are ‘Reaccumulating’ rather than getting caught in a ‘Bear Trap’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the Neutral major pivot point and the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW. This tightening range is beginning to signal that breakout pressure is building and that the market is about to test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ as ‘Smart Money’ confirms a solid Support. At MAX, the price will test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580. We will focus on our 1st Targets, as this remains a testing range where healthy pullbacks are expected. A 2nd Target in either direction would merely indicate that the market was not comfortable, either pulling back too far to build new Support or extending beyond because it confirmed sufficient Momentum to take off; that scenario would need to be analyzed as a proceeding market dynamic from what we are observing now. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-17 16:03:19,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our retail investors are being triggered by this ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which is leading to some Oversold distribution but not to the extent that it signals a complete breakdown of the Trend. We can confirm that the Support level is genuine, although there is also a sign that Sell pressure still lingers during this healthy ‘Reaccumulation’ phase while Buyers hesitantly step in due to macro influences. Momentum Indicators show that the market is in Oversold territory, with profit-taking pressure capturing control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands begin to expand. This is a signal of a Consolidation following a Support test. ADX values signal that Trend strength is increasing, with the price remaining BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, which means that the market is struggling to generate active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators lend support to the Bollinger Bands' Downtrend Consolidation signal with Volatility falling but holding in the HIGH of our norms range. Price movements are hovering BELOW the Volatility Bands, showing the depth of Oversold territory. There is a tendency for the price to return WITHIN the Volatility channels for Support/Resistance.

Volume indicators highlight reduced participation in BOTH the Short and Long term, highlighting the level of caution in the current market. Money flow is Oversold, yet a closer look at the CMF reveals that more money continues to flow into the market than profit-taking can move out. Sentiment Indicators show stable levels of HIGH accumulation, which is what we want to see to confirm that we are still in a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase rather than sliding toward a breakdown. The CCI indicates that this Sell pressure expressed a FULL strength in the Short term, reflecting the MAX pressure the market could exert toward a negative Trend cycle. In the Short term, we are facing an extremely Oversold negative Trend cycle that is sapping strength from the Long term Trend cycle; however, the PVT value remains elevated WITHIN a solid Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles highlight record burn milestones, a maturing ecosystem, and technical patterns that support the shift from MEME to an asset with real Utility. There was coverage on Short term challenges, such as falling burn activity and market downturns, but these help ease FUD/FOMO while steering the overall narrative toward sustained development. Institutional support remains positive.

Eventually, this phase should lead to a cleaner recovery with increasing Volume. However, if this recovery Trend persists, it may also indicate that institutional support has not fully kicked in yet and that the market might be dealing with a minor distribution before the FULL transition into ‘Markup’. I keep watching the order book dynamics to verify that the spread remains tight and that the depth on the Buy side continues to increase near our LOWS, showing that institutions are continuing to absorb supply even if the price is bouncing in the Short term. Currently, Buy pressure appears to have nearly Overcome the lingering Bearish Sentiment, so I remain patient and am still waiting for the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase to shift into ‘Markup’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is knocking on the expected bounce point at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440. At LOWEST, the price might extend down to test further WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where we see 2 major retracement levels converging: the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW and the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390. This is an important level of Support because, mathematically, the 14-Day RSI would be at 50% and there is also a convergence where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic would be at 30% at that same price level too. This defined level of Support leads me to believe that we should not see any further significant decline past that point. At MAX, the price will reclaim the Neutral zone and attempt a 1st Target Max at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530. If we can break through that level, the next test would be to challenge the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-16 19:40:17,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ is continuing to absorb some of the residual Sell supply, but despite some Buyer interest, it is still not Strong enough to push the market into a FULL ‘Markup’. Momentum Indicators signal that Neutral ground is forming from ‘Smart Money’s’ ‘Reaccumulation’, counteracting Sell pressure and leaving Sellers with only an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Consolidation phase during the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, emphasizing that underlying breakout pressure is still growing. ADX values highlight Weak/Average Trend strength, with the price remaining BELOW the Supertrend and ALL EMAs while attempting to reach those levels; meaning that the market is trying to revitalize ‘Price Action’ and establish a firm Neutral ground. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal of the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility remaining at the HIGH of our norms range. Price movements are holding WITHIN the channels defined by the Volatility Bands, further supporting the current Consolidation outlook.

Volume Indicators signal Neutral Short term participation, while resilient Long term participation highlights solid underlying support. Money flow data is nearly Neutral, but a closer look shows that slightly more ‘Smart Money’ is accumulating. This is bringing more money into the market than is being moved out by Sellers. Sentiment Indicators point to increased accumulation, indicative of a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase. This counterbalancing act between ‘Smart Money’ and profit-taking Sellers is maintaining a Short term Neutral Trend cycle, while the positive Long term Trend remains intact as seen by the resiliently elevated PVT value. News articles hold a mostly positive bias, providing updates on Shibarium upgrades, ecosystem advancements, and Bullish price predictions that reinforce the Utility narrative. Although Short term coverage of challenges from profit-taking linger, reports of lower burn activity, and falling Volume are highlighted in a fact-based way to continue easing FUD/FOMO. Institutional outlook remains encouraging.

I expect the market to have found some comfort around these Support levels until order flow dynamics begin to improve. This Consolidation phase allows ‘Smart Money’ to accumulate more before the ‘Markup’ phase, which is a healthy underlying signal. We are simply waiting for Volume to pick up; once it does, Bullish Momentum will build and we will begin the transition into the ‘Markup’ phase. For now, exercise some patience and wait for Volume acceleration during an Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH and the Neutral major pivot point. This defined Neutral range is beginning to tighten and converge with other Supports, extending from $0.00001510 down to $0.00001480. At MAX, the market will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001700. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001420 as a Short Support test.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-15 19:56:37,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our retail investors are being triggered by this ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which is leading to some Oversold distribution but not to the extent that it would signal a complete breakdown of the Uptrend. Momentum Indicators signal that the market is in Oversold condition, where profit-taking has elevated Sellers over multiple time frames to Average levels of Bearish control. Trend Indicators reveal the deep extent of how far prices are Oversold, with the price sitting FAR BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, showing that buildup pressure for a breakout is underlying the current Trend. ADX values show Average Bearish Trend strength, holding the price FAR BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. The current market shows a lack of ‘Price Action’ due to the charts indicating EXTREME Overreaction in Oversold territory. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal of the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility remaining at the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are FAR BELOW our Volatility Bands, setting the stage for a rebound as the price works its way back WITHIN those channels of Support/Resistance.

Volume Indicators highlight a Short term reduction in participation, while the Long term picture reveals the ‘Reaccumulation’ cycle that ‘Smart Money’ has cultivated. Money flow data indicates Oversold strength, with the insight from the CMF showing Neutral levels of money flow and a very small edge of positive bias toward ‘Smart Money’s’ accumulation efforts. Sentiment Indicators signal that despite the Strong pullback, ‘Smart Money’ is capturing positions and accumulating at greater levels than Sellers are distributing. When you look at the CCI, you see just how Strong an Overreaction the Sellers have expressed. Despite this Strong Overreaction, the market has retained its position in a Long term positive Trend cycle. News was overall Bullish, with the Long term outlook being highlighted through reports of token burns, whale accumulation, and technical breakouts which continue reinforcing the Utility narrative. Although there is attention on Short term cautions, with Articles covering profit-taking and Short term technical negatives, the broader narrative was focused on alleviating FUD/FOMO while revealing the institutional perception of SHIB and the ongoing ecosystem enhancements.

The market needs to get on a treadmill and work on its cardio because this Long breather is triggering some retail investors; however, the ‘Reaccumulation’ dynamic remains intact. We are still in a Long term Uptrend cycle. Based on the Long term dynamic positioning and the current ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, it is not uncommon to see Bearish pressure pull back to Support levels as ‘Smart Money’ will test different Support levels before stepping up accumulation. Some ‘Smart Money’ appears to have been digesting some of their gains, and this may cause us to continue through this dynamic with elevated caution. I would highlight that this is an opportunity to absorb some of the Sell pressure before this temporary pullback leads to a fundamental Trend reversal, allowing the rest of the dynamic framework to play out all the way to the ‘Markup’ phase. What I am mainly watching for is the point at which Volume begins to decline as the price falls and then picks up on the bounce. That pickup will show that Buyers are absorbing the Volume and taking greater control even if the Sentiment remains Bearish. Price stabilization will mark the area of the bounce.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting just BELOW the Neutral zone, testing the FULL ‘Wall of Support’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530. The market is testing the lower Target range of the 2nd Target LOW from yesterday, which rests at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001480. The ABSOLUTE LOWEST Target price potential before causing a Trend breakdown would be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390; such a level would constitute the failure of Support for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price will follow Targets, with the 1st Target MAX set to capture the Neutral major pivot point at the TOP of the Neutral zone at $0.00001600. If we see a FULL Uptrend reversal, the TOP of that cycle would be to test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ all the way to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001770.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-14 19:53:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Nice little controlled pullback and bounce pattern during ‘Reaccumulation’ that still falls within the dynamic framework we’ve been following. Momentum Indicators signal that the market is continuing to rise from Neutral ground with Buyers taking control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is attempting to break  WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. Currently, AT the LOW Band, this points to the lingering Bearish Consolidation; however, with our Bollinger Bands beginning to contract again, it implies that Sellers have run out of strength and Buyers are slowly lifting the market. ADX values show Average Trend strength with the price still BELOW our Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet we remain ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, signaling that there is still underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal that Volatility remains at the HIGH end of our norms range while price movements stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands’ Support/Resistance channels. This highlights the current Consolidation and the framework WITHIN which the price will attempt to move.

Volume Indicators are signaling increasing participation. Money flow is at an Average strength, but when you examine the details of the distribution, more money is flowing into the market than is being moved out. Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong levels of accumulation at which ‘Smart Money’ is reaccumulating. This strategic participation has added even greater strength to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to show a Bullish outlook with headlines about token burns, price moves, and technical patterns. They do note some Short term signs of profit-taking and Resistance levels, but these fact-based articles help ease FUD/FOMO while showing the shifting institutional narrative toward utilization.

The market is gathering strength by testing Support near the BOTTOM of my algorithm's range and then moving toward Neutral. This reflects an underlying structure WITHIN the cycle that confirms IT IS STILL INTACT. Things are starting to improve gradually and, based on this part of the price structure, we would want to see Volume give us a clear signal that the cycle is ready to push into the ‘Markup’ phase. Rather than simply stating that I expect an Uptrend continuation, which I have expected for the past few days, ‘Smart Money’ will ultimately dictate when this occurs. Volume Indicators are going to provide some of the greatest insights into when Sellers are easing their aggressive counterbalance to the Trend and when the market is ready to move from this temporary Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001590. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 1st Target MAX at the 1st-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001710. At LOWEST, the price will reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which acts as the BOTTOM of the Neutral range at $0.00001530.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-13 19:48:24,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that ‘Smart Money’ has just about finished with the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, having moved through about the last of the Sellers’ supply. Momentum Indicators show the Neutral ground is well defined, with the last of the ‘Sell Wall’ giving Sellers the spotlight and control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, attempting to place pressure against the HIGH Band, which confirms the Consolidation we were experiencing and indicates that breakout pressure is building. We captured the Bollinger Bands at the MAX of the expansion, which means that as the Bollinger Bands contract from this position, breakout pressure will continually grow. ADX values signal an Average Trend strength that elevated the price TO the Supertrend while rising ABOVE ALL EMAs, signaling a more growing level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators show that Volatility remains ABOVE the HIGH of our norms range, and price movements have recaptured the Support/Resistance channels defined by the Volatility Bands. This indicates that the market has reached an area to begin building support and moving through these channels.

Volume Indicators reveal participation levels consistent with the ‘Reaccumulation’ outlook. Money flow data reveals that more money was moved out of the market than in during this Short period, which further supports the intrinsic undervaluation and helps define a greater margin of safety. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution during the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, with these levels surprisingly only lending a Weak level of negative pressure against the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by maintaining the elevated PVT value. News articles address the Short term with a mix of fact-based insights, yet overall the Bullish Utility narrative continues with highlights of whale accumulation, breakout forecasts, and burn rates. They outline the massive ‘Sell Wall’, price loss, and potential liquidation zones to remind investors of the Short term risks, while still providing insights into the levels of institutional support.

We are following proper dynamics and respecting our Support and Resistance levels during the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which appears to finally be running the last bit of its course. I anticipate Uptrend continuation as demand is rather HIGH, with ‘Smart Money’ absorbing so much of the supply during this final pullback.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is still WITHIN the Neutral zone, resting ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001600. This psychological level of Support in the Neutral zone has created a very healthy base for price appreciation moving forward. At MAX, the price will begin testing the full range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, with the 1st Target MAX set at the 1st-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001720. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001870. From there, we will attempt to establish Support around the 38.2% retracement of the 52‑Week LOW at $0.00001910, up to the TOP of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001990. At LOWEST, there is so much built-up Support that the price will touch the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001450, but it would only bounce back with ‘Reaccumulation’.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-12 19:36:50,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, it looked like yesterday that smart money had absorbed the last of the supply and that Sell pressure was beginning to weaken. I applied my algorithm to the Neutral range instead of the LOWEST, anticipating that we were finally at Neutral ground, but it appears we are NOW in the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’. Momentum Indicators signal that ‘Smart Money‘ is increasing activity at this level, with strength beginning to lift from the Neutral zone while leaving Buyers in control of the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, applying pressure on the LOW Band to reveal the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’. Bollinger Bands are moving by small incremental values again, which means a ballooning breakout pressure. ADX values highlight Strong Trend strength, with the price being held WELL BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet we remain above the 200-Day, signaling active ‘Price Action’ hidden in this FUD/FOMO driven Short Seller Downtrend. Volatility Indicators still reveal that Volatility is ABOVE the HIGH of our norms range, and when prices are WELL BELOW the Volatility Bands, it confirms that breakout pressure is building and that we will eventually return WITHIN those Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ participation is holding back the Weak conviction Short Sellers in the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’ while moving more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong accumulation, with Buyer strength lending a consistent level of positive support to the Long term Trend cycle, as seen by the ever-increasing PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with positive insights that highlight technical breakout signals, forecasts for explosive rallies, and strong whale activity, all fact-based. There are cautions concerning the ‘Sell Wall’ and some Overbought Short term alerts, but these serve to counter FUD/FOMO while still encouraging investors and reinforcing institutional support.

We are still seeing the last of the remaining supply being absorbed by ‘Smart Money’, which continues to set the stage for Uptrend continuation and the ‘Markup’ phase. LOW Volume near a Support test means that we will be seeing a structured price appreciation as our demand grows. Many investors are misreading the market, because we are not seeing any reversal triggers from distribution. Our ‘Reaccumulation Zones’ simply build more energy for the ‘Markup’ phase. Volume rejection at Resistances would signal a Bearish divergence and cycle exhaustion; however, before any MASS distribution occurs, we would see Consolidation or even Redistribution!! It is somewhat amusing to see these Short Sellers get caught in ANOTHER ‘Bear Trap’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530, which is WITHIN the Neutral zone. This Short term test of Neutral Supports could potentially see the market reach as LOW as the LOWEST Neutral major pivot point at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001450. At MAX, the market will look to retest the ‘Wall of Resistance’ in 3 Target phases. 1st Target MAX is at the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580. 2nd Target MAX is the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001640. 3rd Target MAX is the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001730.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection monday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. well, it looked like yesterday that smart money had absorbed the last of the supply and that sell pressure was beginning to weaken. i applied my algorithm to the neutral range instead of the lowest, anticipating that we were finally at neutral ground, but it appears we are now in the reaccumulation zone. momentum indicators signal that smart money is increasing activity at this level, with strength beginning to lift from the neutral zone while leaving buyers in control of the market. trend indicators show that the price is within the ichimoku cloud, applying pressure on the low band to reveal the reaccumulation zone. bollinger bands are moving by small incremental values again, which means a ballooning breakout pressure. adx values highlight strong trend strength, with the price being held well below the supertrend and short term emas, yet we remain above the 200day, signaling active price action hidden in this fudfear of missing out driven short seller downtrend. volatility indicators still reveal that volatility is above the high of our norms range, and when prices are well below the volatility bands, it confirms that breakout pressure is building and that we will eventually return within those supportresistance channels. volume indicators show that smart money participation is holding back the weak conviction short sellers in the reaccumulation zone while moving more money into the market than sellers can move out. sentiment indicators continue to highlight strong accumulation, with buyer strength lending a consistent level of positive support to the long term trend cycle, as seen by the everincreasing pvt value. news articles continue the optimistic utility narrative with positive insights that highlight technical breakout signals, forecasts for explosive rallies, and strong whale activity, all factbased. there are cautions concerning the sell wall and some overbought short term alerts, but these serve to counter fudfear of missing out while still encouraging investors and reinforcing institutional support. we are still seeing the last of the remaining supply being absorbed by smart money, which continues to set the stage for uptrend continuation and the markup phase. low volume near a support test means that we will be seeing a structured price appreciation as our demand grows. many investors are misreading the market, because we are not seeing any reversal triggers from distribution. our reaccumulation zones simply build more energy for the markup phase. volume rejection at resistances would signal a pessimistic divergence and cycle exhaustion however, before any mass distribution occurs, we would see consolidation or even redistribution!! it is somewhat amusing to see these short sellers get caught in another bear trap. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is resting at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week high at 0.001530, which is within the neutral zone. this short term test of neutral supports could potentially see the market reach as low as the lowest neutral major pivot point at the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001450. at max, the market will look to retest the wall of resistance in 3 target phases. 1st target max is at the 2ndlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001580. 2nd target max is the 2ndlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001640. 3rd target max is the 3rdlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001730. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.6710711969062686,POSITIVE
2025-05-11 20:02:32,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These are the early signs that ‘Smart Money’ has nearly finished absorbing our supply while the market rests on a solid Support base before moving into the ‘Markup’ phase at what appears to be a final checkpoint showing institutional investors have capped our Sell pressure. Momentum Indicators show Neutral ground while ‘Smart Money’ continues to reaccumulate during the pause. While maintaining stable levels of control over multiple time frames, our Buyers are setting the stage for the ‘Markup’ phase while providing some of the last chances to accumulate with each pullback. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is resting AT and breaking ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bullish test of Support, while Bollinger Bands support this outlook with expansion that signals Consolidation. Average Trend strength continues to hold the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, while the price occasionally bounces off the Short term EMA to reveal its tendency to accelerate and then calm ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators give additional insight into the Bollinger Bands expansion that signals Consolidation, while also preserving the outlook of a breakout phase that is ballooning in strength as Volatility has risen ABOVE the HIGH end of our norms range. Volatility Bands have caught up to price movements and are supporting the outlook of Uptrend continuation.

Volume Indicators again highlight the early signs of participants’ intended direction for the next phase, as investors are increasing positions in the Short term after a strategic pullback signaled by the Long term values. Money flow in general is at a Neutral level, but when you look at how Buyers and Sellers are influencing this flow, it is clear that more money is continuously flowing in at Strong levels over that which is moving out of the market. Sentiment Indicators support this by revealing continuing Strong levels of accumulation while strategically adding a small amount of strength to the Long term Trend cycle. PVT values reveal that the Long term positive Trend cycle has increased even further due to this activity that others may see as a negative pullback, yet this strategic participation has been a positive catalyst. News articles are showing a Strong Bullish bias lately with reports of increasing burn rates, technical breakout patterns, and timelines showing the shift from MEME to Utility. These articles highlight the strength of the community with very few negative scenarios, while fact-based insights continue to counter FUD/FOMO and underline the institutional support.

We are still following basic dynamics for reaccumulation, and these Short Consolidation patterns are opportunities for the market to catch its breath while allowing institutional ‘Smart Money’ to build larger positions for the next phase. The Short test of demand really helps set up the next breakout cycle; any secondary accumulation does not mean a ‘Markup’ is unlikely, only that if demand continues to outpace supply, we have confirmation for the rally’s continuation. Anticipate Short pullbacks as the market establishes higher Support levels.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is beginning to work its way through the ‘Wall of Resistance’, resting just BELOW the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001640, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. The market will attempt to establish our next Support Target at the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001730. That is a Neutral range where the market will establish solid Support. 1st Target MAX will be for the market to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001910. At LOWEST, the market will reach down to the defined stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001590.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-10 19:58:51,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This is an interesting pause where the market is catching its breath at a major level of Long term Fibonacci Support before deciding its next move. Momentum Indicators highlight the lingering pressure of profit-taking rising in an attempt to counteract the Buy pressure. Despite the increased Sell pressure, Buyers remain in Strong control of the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Bullish breakout phase. Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract again, giving an early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values reveal a steady level of Average Trend strength holding the price WELL ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, which signals a heightened level of underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators further add support to the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGHEST of our norms range. The fact that price movements remain ABOVE the HIGH Volatility Bands confirms the Bullish breakout while respecting the current Consolidation and adds support to the outlook of breakout continuation. This occurs because the Bands are trying to catch up to the price rather than the price retreating WITHIN the Bands.

Volume Indicators are where I take the most interest because this Short term increase in participation signals the direction the market wants to take. We can see that the market is roughly at a Neutral level in terms of money flow, but when you examine how the money is moving, more money is flowing into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators further reveal Strong levels of accumulation during this ‘Distribution’ phase. Although Buyers have not yet expressed the full strength of their potential influence on price movement, they have crossed the Short term Oversold benchmark. This level of ‘Base Building’ activity further elevates the positive value of the PVT and shows that a Strong Long term Trend cycle is being cultivated even further. News articles continue to cover the transformation of SHIB while also maintaining a Strong Bullish bias. They highlight technical breakout signals, explosive token burn rates, and increasing Volumes that support some of the ambitious price targets being set. Although there is plenty of positive insight and institutional support, there remains coverage of the ‘Sell Wall’ and some of the underlying volatile whale dynamics. Overall, these remain fact-based cautions that remind us of the realistic challenges that persist and still help counter FUD/FOMO.

Right now we are seeing a phase of ‘Smart Money’ accumulation during what appears to be a ‘Distribution’ phase. The interesting thing is that this is not a true ‘Distribution’ phase but really a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase. The fact that capital is flowing into the market the way it is implies that Buyers are absorbing the supply even if the price appears stalled. This Consolidation is not a sign of weakness but a strategic repositioning by ‘Smart Money’. The Bullish strength at this point is not just price driven; it is being supported by Strong capital inflows. We have Strong institutional conviction over longer intervals, meaning that a reversal is unlikely in the face of ongoing accumulation. Based on the Indicators, I expect to see a continuation of the breakout as soon as ‘Smart Money’ is done catching its breath and taking positions from profit-taking distribution.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT a defined stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001590. While the market catches its breath, I anticipate that the test of this Long term Fibonacci level will act as our new Support BOTTOM at $0.00001564. At MAX, the price will attempt to test the full range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level pivot point at $0.00001730. At LOWEST, the price will test the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement Support level at $0.00001564.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-09 19:53:14,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

What an amazing Uptrend cycle! This is my hobby, and I feel like the cast they portray in the movie ‘Twister’, OLD ‘Twister’, and I'm screaming, ""We got one, we got one!"" This is a beautiful dynamic playing out and, based on my methodologies, we haven't seen anything yet. Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ has FULL control of the market with Buyers leading the Uptrend cycle over multiple time frames. These levels are now at the Short term benchmark for being Oversold. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WELL ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Bullish Uptrend cycle. When you combine this with the massive expansion of our Bollinger Bands, it means we will Consolidate the gains, which is exactly what we're beginning to experience. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength over both Short and Long time frames, holding the price WAY ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This signals that the current level of ‘Price Action’ is EXTREME. Volatility Indicators further validate the Consolidation outlook, with Volatility zooming to the HIGH of our norms range. Uptrending price fluctuations are bouncing ABOVE the HIGH Volatility Bands, even further supporting the outlook for Consolidation of the gains.

Volume Indicators fully highlight those first signs of Consolidation, as Volume is at the same level as in the previous Consolidation phase. It is reassuring to see these align because they occur within the proper multi-horizon time frame window to make averages. Despite the Short term Consolidation outlook, ‘Smart Money’ and Buyers are moving more money into the market than is moved out by profit-taking or Seller activity. The nice thing is that this activity is just ABOVE a Neutral value, meaning that Average pace is driving all of this ‘Price Action’. Just wait until it ramps up to FULL strength! Sentiment Indicators show Strong ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, with Buyers entering the MAX potential pressure zone in the Short term and adding positive weight to our Long term Trend cycle. This positive Short term strength has accelerated the PVT back into solid Long term support, as seen by the sharply increased value. News articles are not shy about the Utility narrative and their Bullish Long term bias with highlights of Strong technical breakouts, surging burn rates, strategic whale accumulation, and exciting ecosystem upgrades. All of these factors fuel our Bullish Momentum with very few negative insights. The fact-based approach continues to be the counter to FUD/FOMO, and institutional awareness continues to grow.

I am absolutely thrilled to be witnessing clear staging and dynamic play out in the charts. We are in a transitional stage right now between the ‘Breakout Initiation’ and the ‘Markup’ phase. This aligns with my previous analysis that identified this as the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Looking at this current midpoint Consolidation and early setup for the ‘Markup’ phase, I expect to see a test of the Consolidation channel that will align these levels from my go-to Fibonacci and Elliott Wave analyses. This is a good sign that the Bullish energy from our Buyers is being expressed as they can take a moment to accumulate and begin confidently pushing further. After this pause, which we see as Consolidation, it should not be taken as weakness but rather as a natural part of the dynamic where our ‘Smart Money’ validates there is enough safety before committing to the FULL surge. In my own methodologies, I view this as a ‘Margin of Safety’ for the ‘Smart Money’. This is an intermediate phase that acts as the springboard for price acceleration, so look for Volume to signal that Buyers are overcoming any residual hesitation from the less aggressive investors. That is when you will see the clear characteristics of the ‘Markup’ phase beginning. Pullbacks are minor and accumulations are healthy; these tests just add extra validation for ‘Smart Money’ to drive the price higher toward the next Target. It is as if ‘Smart Money’ is checking, ""Is everybody okay? Is everybody still here? All right, let's go again."" I believe we have a structurally sound dynamic playing out before our eyes, and we should keep expecting a gradual Uptrend followed by an accelerated phase of price appreciation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has broken ABOVE our Target level at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001460. We are hovering near the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00001560. This means the Consolidation range should be from $0.00001460 up to $0.00001560. 1st Target MAX will be to finish testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level pivot point at $0.00001670. The next Consolidation channel should be from $0.00001670 up to the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001730. From there, the market will look to accelerate to 2nd Target MAX at the 38.2% retracement of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001910. The next Consolidation channel would extend from the mathematical average of the 14-Day RSI reaching 80% at $0.00001980, up to the 50% retracement of the 52-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00002180. We will continue to assess this in stages based on Targets.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-08 20:05:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We have finally made it to the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase and the market has confirmed the expression of its full strength by reaching the HIGH set by my algorithm. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers have grabbed the market and are not being shy about pressing full strength against any Seller activity, allowing ‘Smart Money’ to take full control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is well ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is Bullish, but when we factor in the expansion of the Bollinger Bands, they signal an early sign of Consolidation. ADX values highlight Strong Bullish Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a period of active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators add further support to the Consolidation outlook as Volatility remains at the LOW/Neutral end of our norms range, with price movements rising ABOVE the Volatility Bands. This further validates the ‘Breakout Initiation’ cycle while also supporting an outlook for Consolidation of the gains.

Volume Indicators signal some of the first signs of our Consolidation as participation declined in the Short term; however, underneath this is the remnant of Strong Buyer activity, with more money flowing into the market than is moving out. Sentiment Indicators show a Strong level of accumulation, with Buyers adding more positive weight to the Long term Trend cycle. News articles are picking up on the market's movements and continue with the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting Strong technical signals, increasing token burn rates, and rising trade Volumes that signal a Long term cycle of transformation for SHIB and the ecosystem. Although News continues to dominate with Bullish articles, they still use fact-based analysis of technical data to counter FUD/FOMO while highlighting the Short term cautions that are realistic for our market. Positive institutional awareness for utilization is growing!

Now that we have validated the dynamic cycle and can identify this phase as the ‘Breakout Initiation’, we need to understand what happens during this cycle. First, we must expect a Consolidation, and the charts currently show that, which is a healthy feature of this phase. As we go through the Consolidation phase, our ‘Smart Money’ is able to confirm that the Resistance barrier between the accumulation cycle and the ‘Markup’ phase is a firm level of safety. This is technically called a ‘Preliminary Support Test’. Once the price is done testing and there is no reversal following Consolidation, the stage will be set for our ‘Markup’ phase. This will be a series of higher HIGHS and higher LOWS in which ‘Smart Money’ drives the price through brief Consolidations that will serve to verify that the accumulation is effective while the market is transitioning into the Uptrend. In this dynamic cycle, you really want to see increased Volume occurring ABOVE the identified level of Support/Resistance. We are literally on the cusp of liftoff!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has broken ABOVE and is holding our 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. We will be moving according to our Targets; the 1st target acts as initial Support for the current Trend. Since we are expecting a Consolidation phase, the price will go no lower than that 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380, as this would constitute the Short BOTTOM. The well-defined stall range at the convergence of the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages at $0.00001410 would then mark the TOP of the Neutral range for this current Consolidation. Our next Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001460. If pressure expresses itself with increased Volume, the MAX Target of the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase would be to reach the mathematical point where the 14-Day RSI would be at 70% at $0.00001620. From there, we would assess the ‘Markup’ phase, but for now let us focus on this current dynamic cycle to see how far ‘Smart Money’ can express itself.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection thursday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. we have finally made it to the breakout initiation phase and the market has confirmed the expression of its full strength by reaching the high set by my algorithm. momentum indicators show that buyers have grabbed the market and are not being shy about pressing full strength against any seller activity, allowing smart money to take full control of the market over multiple time frames. trend indicators reveal that the price is well above the ichimoku cloud, which is optimistic, but when we factor in the expansion of the bollinger bands, they signal an early sign of consolidation. adx values highlight strong optimistic trend strength holding the price above the supertrend and all emas, revealing a period of active price action. volatility indicators add further support to the consolidation outlook as volatility remains at the lowneutral end of our norms range, with price movements rising above the volatility bands. this further validates the breakout initiation cycle while also supporting an outlook for consolidation of the gains. volume indicators signal some of the first signs of our consolidation as participation declined in the short term however, underneath this is the remnant of strong buyer activity, with more money flowing into the market than is moving out. sentiment indicators show a strong level of accumulation, with buyers adding more positive weight to the long term trend cycle. news articles are picking up on the markets movements and continue with the optimistic utility narrative by highlighting strong technical signals, increasing token burn rates, and rising trade volumes that signal a long term cycle of transformation for shib and the ecosystem. although news continues to dominate with optimistic articles, they still use factbased analysis of technical data to counter fudfear of missing out while highlighting the short term cautions that are realistic for our market. positive institutional awareness for utilization is growing! now that we have validated the dynamic cycle and can identify this phase as the breakout initiation, we need to understand what happens during this cycle. first, we must expect a consolidation, and the charts currently show that, which is a healthy feature of this phase. as we go through the consolidation phase, our smart money is able to confirm that the resistance barrier between the accumulation cycle and the markup phase is a firm level of safety. this is technically called a preliminary support test. once the price is done testing and there is no reversal following consolidation, the stage will be set for our markup phase. this will be a series of higher highs and higher lows in which smart money drives the price through brief consolidations that will serve to verify that the accumulation is effective while the market is transitioning into the uptrend. in this dynamic cycle, you really want to see increased volume occurring above the identified level of supportresistance. we are literally on the cusp of liftoff! long term support and resistances indicate that the price has broken above and is holding our 1st target at the 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001380. we will be moving according to our targets the 1st target acts as initial support for the current trend. since we are expecting a consolidation phase, the price will go no lower than that 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001380, as this would constitute the short bottom. the welldefined stall range at the convergence of the 3day, 10day, and 16day macd moving averages at 0.001410 would then mark the top of the neutral range for this current consolidation. our next target will be to capture the 38.2 retracement of the 13week high at 0.001460. if pressure expresses itself with increased volume, the max target of the breakout initiation phase would be to reach the mathematical point where the 14day rsi would be at 70 at 0.001620. from there, we would assess the markup phase, but for now let us focus on this current dynamic cycle to see how far smart money can express itself. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.9108534303959459,POSITIVE
2025-05-07 20:19:45,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like not much has changed in terms of market position other than ‘Smart Money’ accumulating through the dip. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market has returned to Neutral ground with Buyers holding a strategic yet Weak level of control. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Consolidation phase of the current market. Bollinger Bands reveal expansion; to me, this appears as a contraction phase that is ballooning to show a stronger breakout pressure underlying. ADX values signal Weak Trend strength, with the price AT the Supertrend level and working through Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. This reveals the market's attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range while price movements began rising through the Volatility Bands to place pressure against the HIGH Bands. This supports an outlook from the Bollinger Bands indicating growing breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators show a Short term pause in participation during the Consolidation phase, while the CMF reveals an increasing rate at which ‘Smart Money’ is taking positions and an increased level of money continuing to flow into the market compared to outflows from Sellers. Sentiment Indicators highlight ‘Smart Money's’ Strong level of accumulation. This heightened level of Buy activity confirms the strength of our Support levels while preserving the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles ramp up coverage of Bullish utilization by highlighting increasingly positive technical signals, huge price forecasts, and strategic ecosystem upgrades. Despite the Long term Support from the Utility narrative, articles offer fact-based insights into whale activity and potential Sell traps that they identify as areas of Short term Volatility. While still helping to alleviate FUD/FOMO, the articles are increasingly encouraging to investors and offer institutional insights.

Dynamics are converging while the market holds in a wait-and-see phase for clearer signals and confirmation from Volume. As the market absorbs the catalyst, we have some underlying cautious Sentiment that will only temper the return to the previous dynamic cycle. As we continue, it will be a little more restrained than our previous expectations, but nonetheless, we are just waiting for the market to catalyze ‘Price Action’ in an extended Consolidation phase.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Neutral zone at the Long term Neutral major pivot point. Since this is an extended Consolidation phase, the Neutral zone extends from the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 down to our previous close price at $0.00001250. At MAX, the 1st Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and touch the Long term Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-06 19:37:57,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I'm just going to come right out and say that I find pre-announcement Consolidations to be absolutely annoying, but I get it. While ‘Smart Money’ waits for the outcome of the FOMC meeting, this high-impact catalyst has caused those traders to reduce their activity, leading to a period of LOW Volume before the market decisively begins moving again. Either way, today gives us insight into the market's sensitivity to event risks and external catalysts. Momentum Indicators reveal that, despite the pullback from Buyers, there was also less Seller activity. That means that the Buyers' reduced level of activity is still holding the market at about the same Neutral position as yesterday. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while placing pressure on the LOW Band, supporting a simple outlook of Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which highlights the buildup of breakout pressure. ADX values signal Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels, revealing a lack of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal with Volatility rising to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands highlight Consolidation and Neutral Support.

Volume Indicators signal a strategic level of participation that holds the market in a Neutral state while ‘Smart Money’ continues to move more money into the market than Sellers are moving out. Sentiment Indicators reveal distribution, but it appears that ‘Smart Money’ is combining Short term profit-taking to hold the market strategically at a Neutral level while they gauge the impact of the FOMC results. Despite this Short term event-driven Consolidation, the market remains in a Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient, positive PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with highlights of token burns, technical breakout signals, and ecosystem upgrades. Despite these positive Long term insights, they offer fact-based caution by covering the ‘Sell Wall’, heavy Sell pressure, and Short term price struggles that help continue to counter FUD/FOMO while remaining optimistic about realistic challenges.

I find event-based Consolidations irritating, but there remains an underlying excitement. In my mind there are only 2 scenarios. ‘Smart Money’ already has an expectation and will not be surprised if there is no change and the result remains Neutral; in that case, we would continue in the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Alternatively, if the results are more positive than expected, an explosive amount of Momentum will occur in the market, and we would still continue the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase except with a turbo. I highly doubt any negative impact from the FOMC results, so I see this only going 1 of 2 ways. Now we sit back and wait; I hope you got the entry you wanted!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has made its way INSIDE the Neutral zone, still BELOW the Short and Long term Neutral major pivot points. At LOWEST, the market will touch our Long term MAJOR Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. I do not see us going any lower. At MAX, I can see us breaking into the ‘Wall of Resistance’ to test the 1st Target MAX at $0.00001330. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. And just to be nice, the 3rd Target MAX will be $0.00001460.

Buyers are ramping up pressure against the ‘Sell Wall’ in an attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’ and smooth the market into the next dynamic phase cycle. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are strategically increasing pressure at a stable pace while steering the market to Neutral ground and leaving Sellers with Weak control. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which seems to highlight that the ‘Bear Trap’ phase is coming to an end and that a Bullish Consolidation cycle is active. Bollinger Bands show expansion, which is an early sign of Consolidation in conjunction with the insight of the price’s position WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and recapturing the Short term EMA levels while still attempting to reach our 200-Day EMA to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility remaining at the LOW/NEUTRAL of our norms range. Price movements are recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting the current Bullish Consolidation phase.

Volume Indicators highlight the surging participation we were looking for, which is indicative of the beginning of our ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Despite seeing Sellers with Weak control of the market, ‘Smart Money’ is now beginning to move more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators support this with signs of Strong levels of accumulation that are greater than the distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’. Also, the CCI confirms the Neutral ground I was referring to. PVT values indicate that ‘Smart Money’ has strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle and that we may be on the cusp of a major breakout soon. News articles have shifted their focus from the Short term struggles to highlight the Long term Bullish Utility narrative further, but they are tempered with reports that continue highlighting the significant Sell pressure from Weak activity and the sheer size of the ‘Sell Wall’. These cautions are fact-based and help alleviate FUD/FOMO, while still allowing us to see Strong positive signals for growth from token burns, promising technical signals, and Shibarium developments. They continue to signal Long term institutional support and awareness too.

I expect things to continue following the identified dynamics we have been able to support with technicals and fundamentals . This appears to be the last of the ‘Shake’ and the more welcoming side of Consolidation, where we begin Uptrending at a stable pace as seen by the Average True Range retaining such a LOW value. This phase, which we have observed over the past couple of days, is what I would characterize as an accumulation area where ‘Smart Money’ is able to find enough Sellers to build what I use in my own methodologies as an ‘Antifragile’ position. This is a wise move because, when you think about it, they are able to absorb the ‘Sell Wall’ while also converging a technical structure with a liquidity dynamic. Just look at the ‘Bear Trap’ that was set recently that led to the position we are at now. I would not say that it is manipulation, but it is a consistent strategic position that is also creating a cushion for the market moving forward, as their position creates a hedge against any market shocks that we could experience from external catalysts. My advice is to be patient, get ready, and follow the dynamics because the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase is about to begin soon.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW, which is acting as our current very Short term (NOW) Neutral major pivot point. Thinking about it in increasing time frames, the next Neutral major pivot point to capture would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. The market wants to return to the Long term Neutral zone, which is all the way up near the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. That is just the Neutral ground breakdown. At MAX, the market will attempt to reach its 1st Target after the Neutral zone at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. Let us focus only on the 1st Targets because that is where the market is at. The LOWEST point is our 1st and ONLY LOW Target, and it aligns with the Long term MAJOR Support at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. A fall BELOW that level would constitute a CRITICAL decline.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-04 20:02:51,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ has Sellers hitting the floor price in a tight Consolidation phase where we have a narrow micro Support and Resistance range serving as an accumulation area and continuing to set the stage for a breakout. Momentum Indicators reveal Buyers moving with caution against the remaining ‘Sell Wall’, as it has the potential to shake out Weak conviction whales. Currently, this cautious exchange holds just ABOVE Oversold levels, with Sellers maintaining a sustained Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are in a contraction that is expanding; I won't call it an expansion, just a growing contraction phase that holds a resilient breakout signal. ADX values show elevated yet Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a lack of ‘Price Action’ in the current market. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, as Volatility has fallen deeper into the LOW end of our norms range. Volatility Bands are tightening as the price attempts to Consolidate within their Support channels, confirming a Bearish Consolidation phase.

Volume Indicators continue to show increased participation, yet in the Short term we can see a cautious pause, which may be our calm before the storm. The ‘Sell Wall’ continues to move more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ is accumulating. Sentiment Indicators reveal an institutional level of caution for the current market, where we still maintain Strong levels of distribution, though at drastically reduced levels. This Short term strength has been able to sustain the Short term negative Trend cycle but was unable to strengthen it any further, as seen by the PVT holding a Strong positive value which indicates the resiliency of the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the Utility narrative with Strong signals of utilization from Shibarium transactions and the potential catalyst from influencers, which continue to highlight our evolution while helping to counter FUD/FOMO. Coverage of widespread dumping and the heavy Sell pressure from different groups helps remind investors of the Short term challenges that remain.

It looks like not much has changed as far as a Consolidation phase running sideways, which I must admit is boring rather than alarming, personally. This cautious pause from ‘Smart Money’ is not random but still part of a well-defined structure. Though we don't see it, ‘Smart Money’ is still accumulating quietly, and we are simply waiting for an intraday breakout in the Volume Indicators. Now it's just waiting through a packed, DMV waiting room style Consolidation phase that is going to take some discipline. Just to suggest some stability: if you're scared of the breakout failing, then set a stop-loss at 1 ATR movement (or roughly $0.00000012) below the current Supports. That way you respect discipline and remove the emotional bias of your untrained eyes perceiving a Downtrend, so you gain conviction and don't get shaken out.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT a Short term market BOTTOM at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At LOWEST, our Short and Long term align to show that the true CRITICAL BOTTOM is at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. At MAX, the price is going to recapture the Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ for directional bias at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‑Week LOW at $0.00001370.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection sunday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. smart money has sellers hitting the floor price in a tight consolidation phase where we have a narrow micro support and resistance range serving as an accumulation area and continuing to set the stage for a breakout. momentum indicators reveal buyers moving with caution against the remaining sell wall, as it has the potential to shake out weak conviction whales. currently, this cautious exchange holds just above oversold levels, with sellers maintaining a sustained weak level of control over the market. trend indicators show that the price is below the ichimoku cloud, signaling pessimistic consolidation. bollinger bands are in a contraction that is expanding i will not call it an expansion, just a growing contraction phase that holds a resilient breakout signal. adx values show elevated yet average trend strength holding the price below the supertrend and all emas, revealing a lack of price action in the current market. volatility indicators continue to support the bollinger bands breakout signal, as volatility has fallen deeper into the low end of our norms range. volatility bands are tightening as the price attempts to consolidate within their support channels, confirming a pessimistic consolidation phase. volume indicators continue to show increased participation, yet in the short term we can see a cautious pause, which may be our calm before the storm. the sell wall continues to move more money out of the market than smart money is accumulating. sentiment indicators reveal an institutional level of caution for the current market, where we still maintain strong levels of distribution, though at drastically reduced levels. this short term strength has been able to sustain the short term negative trend cycle but was unable to strengthen it any further, as seen by the pvt holding a strong positive value which indicates the resiliency of the long term positive trend cycle. news articles continue the utility narrative with strong signals of utilization from shibarium transactions and the potential catalyst from influencers, which continue to highlight our evolution while helping to counter fudfear of missing out. coverage of widespread decreaseing and the heavy sell pressure from different groups helps remind investors of the short term challenges that remain. it looks like not much has changed as far as a consolidation phase running sideways, which i must admit is boring rather than alarming, personally. this cautious pause from smart money is not random but still part of a welldefined structure. though we do not see it, smart money is still accumulating quietly, and we are simply waiting for an intraday breakout in the volume indicators. now its just waiting through a packed, dmv waiting room style consolidation phase that is going to take some discipline. just to suggest some stability if you are scared of the breakout failing, then set a stoploss at 1 atr movement or roughly 0.0012 below the current supports. that way you respect discipline and remove the emotional bias of your untrained eyes perceiving a downtrend, so you gain conviction and do not get shaken out. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is resting at a short term market bottom at the 50 retracement of our 4week highlow at 0.001270. at lowest, our short and long term align to show that the true critical bottom is at the 38.2 retracement of our 4week low at 0.001220. at max, the price is going to recapture the neutral major pivot point at the 38.2 retracement of our 4week high at 0.001330. 2nd target max will be to test the wall of resistance for directional bias at the 38.2 retracement of the 13week low at 0.001370. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.0,NEUTRAL

2025-05-03 20:07:09,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This is really amazing to see such a pure dynamic playing out, where currently the price is testing the remaining market and allowing ‘Smart Money’ to determine if it’s time to start the next phase. This is a beautiful ‘Bear Trap’! Momentum Indicators show the last bit of squeeze pressing into Oversold territory, where Sellers have taken Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation; yet when you look at the Bollinger Bands contracting by a value of 1, it implies that the ‘Bear Trap’ is firmly set and breakout pressure is sustaining confirmation. ADX values show stronger yet Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning the market is moving sideways with underlying stability and without ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators reveal that Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range while prices stay BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands. This confirms the Bearish Consolidation and supports the Bollinger Bands signal for building breakout pressure, as the price will look to return WITHIN those Bands of Support and Resistance.

Volume Indicators finally show a massive spike in Short term participation where Sellers pulled the market into the bottom of the wave cycle, which is part of the accumulation dynamic. This, combined with some profit-taking from ‘Smart Money’, helped support the squeeze and began moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight this strategic effort from ‘Smart Money’, combining with the last of the squeezed Sellers. Strong distribution levels, rapidly accelerating into Oversold territory, marking the height of a Short term negative Trend cycle; yet behind all the strategic participation is our Long term positive Trend cycle, which is strengthening as seen by the PVT value sharply increasing. News articles have ramped up the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting impressive technical signals, massive token burn efforts, and the new SHIB Pay. These continue to build investor confidence and counter FUD/FOMO. Their cautions offer mixed market signals by showing some Bearish technical Trends and competition from emerging coins, which helps remind us of the realistic challenges that still lie ahead.

Most will see this as a Downtrend, and it technically is. However, the way I view the charts is that this is the beginning of a new Uptrend. It strategically traps some of the late Sellers and Bears while testing the supply. This was the LOW Volume test of the ‘Shakeout’, and from here I expect the Consolidation to run its course so we can gear up to begin an Uptrend cycle that will test the Resistance boundaries.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is holding WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 2nd-level Support pivot point. The market really wanted to bounce off that 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/HIGH at $0.00001270, and it was a great position to set the ‘Bear Trap’ without needing to respect the Long term Support level at $0.00001220, which coincides with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is the LOWEST point for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price is going to start retracing, and we will follow a path based on the next 3 Targets. 1st Target MAX will be to recapture the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. 3rd Target MAX will be to reach the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.

2025-05-02 19:46:42,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We are following proper market structure and respecting the price dynamics that we have identified over the past couple of days, which point to the formation of a ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are sustaining a stable level of pressure against rising levels of profit-taking, nearly completing the full cycle needed to begin the next phase, despite holding only Weak control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure. ADX values show Average Trend strength, with the price ABOVE the Supertrend and AT the EMA levels across both Long and Short term time frames, meaning the market is attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting both the breakout and Consolidation signals.

Volume Indicators highlight Weak levels of participation, which is encouraging since it reveals fewer Sellers in the market. Buyers, in spite of their Weak control, are continuing to move more money into the market than is being moved out. Sentiment Indicators show the last bit of distribution from Sellers, but this was only enough to counter the Short term Trend and smooth it back to a Neutral Trend cycle. Overall, ‘Smart Money’ has continued to add Bullish pressure and increase the strength of the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue supporting the Utility narrative with Bullish coverage of substantial token burns, technical signals for breakouts, and utility developments like SHIB pay. These articles build the case for incoming HIGHS while also offering fact-based perspectives about the significant ‘Sell Wall’ resistance. These cautions help to counter FUD/FOMO and keep investor expectations based on realistic market challenges.

I feel like I put together a pretty compelling analysis for the potential for the rest of the month, so I do anticipate continuing to see the market dynamics unfold into the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. We might run sideways here and there, but overall Bullish Consolidation should pick up and soon we will start an Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistance signal that the price is resting AT the Neutral zone at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. As investors begin accumulating through this Neutral range, I do not see us going much lower than a test of the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, if we experience a stronger pullback than expected, the Target would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At MAX, the price will rise ABOVE the Neutral zone and break through the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-01 20:18:04,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looking at these charts feels like watching the final pieces of a puzzle fall into place. Momentum Indicators show ‘Smart Money’ increasing the pressure on Seller positions to shake out the last of the Weak conviction profit-taking. This rapid pressure across multiple time frames has led to those few remaining Sellers exercising very Weak control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is rising WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Bullish Consolidation and Uptrend cycle. Bollinger Bands are following that small incremental movement, which is a characteristic dynamic of the market that indicates Consolidation, while underlying this is a ballooning breakout pressure building. ADX values seem to have captured the very beginning of the Uptrend, moving with Average Trend strength and holding the price ABOVE the Superrend and all EMAs to confirm an active level of renewed ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding firm in the Neutral of our norms range. Prices are confirming the Uptrend cycle by elevating through the Volatility Bands and rising ABOVE the HIGH Bands. This further highlights the Bullish Consolidation phase leading into a breakout cycle.

Volume Indicators are confirming the profit-taking, as the reduced level of participation reflects the exit of those Short Sellers, while Long term participation remains stable to show ‘Smart Money’. Despite these matching levels of participation, ‘Smart Money’ is strategically moving more money into the market than Sellers are moving out.  Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong accumulation phase that ‘Smart Money’ has sustained, which has now begun entering its Neutral cycle. This emerging positive Trend cycle will add accelerated strength to the Long term positive Trend if sustained over multiple time frames. News articles have seemingly killed the MEME narrative and are specifically highlighting the Utility aspects of Shiba Inu. Articles emphasizing the size of token burns, technical signals that support incoming highs, and admiration for strategic developments like the Shibarium integration all use positive fact-based coverage to highlight the Resistances and Volumes. This Bullish Long term narrative continues to counter FUD/FOMO while reminding investors of both the potentials and the challenges ahead.

I follow my own methodologies, and based on how I see and assess market dynamics, everything is beginning to be characteristic of the expected next phase: ‘Breakout Initiation’. Usually, the breakout marks a transition where balance shifts from accumulation to a clear Uptrend. In the Short term, we will need to validate the breakout to rule out a one-off spike, but my expectation is that this follows the dynamics I know. We should continue a clear Uptrend with very Short Consolidation phases that are characteristic of accumulation, so do not be scared when you see that small pullback. I expect this to be the beginning of a Long Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is already breaking into the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to reach the next Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. This will be the accumulation area where it looks like Consolidation. At MAX, the price is going to follow Targets, and we are going to attempt to reach the 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470. Beyond that, the 2nd Target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001580. Should this be a one-off spike, the market will pull back within the existing Neutral range between $0.00001330 and $0.00001320. This level is just ABOVE the ‘Wall of Support’, so it would be acceptable to see the market return to this level; however, if the price falls BELOW it, one must assess whether an external catalyst or an internal market dynamic is at work. At LOWEST, the market will have the potential to reach down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-30 19:46:36,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like ‘Smart Money’ has moved through about the last of the ‘Sell Wall’ with Weak conviction Sellers exiting as the price takes one last dip. The accelerated pace of the ‘Sell Wall’ convinced ‘Smart Money’ to rapidly take those positions in response, rather than allowing Volatility to drive the price higher and become exit liquidity for hacker laundering and Weak conviction Sellers. This strategy has lured out the majority of the remaining Sellers in the Long term cycle. Momentum Indicators show Oversold conditions for the Sellers holding Weak levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that despite the Weak pullback into a Bearish Consolidation, the price is hovering AT the Ichimoku Cloud’s LOW Band while still remaining WITHIN the Cloud, confirming the Consolidation of the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands appear to be increasing in value, which would normally signal Consolidation in line with our Ichimoku Cloud reading, but I can see a bubble of breakout strength growing from this increase. ADX values continue to reveal Average Trend strength while the price is firmly BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating a lack of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal from the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility staying in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to place pressure against the LOW Volatility Bands, showing the market's attempts to break out and return to the Neutral range established by those Bands.

Volume Indicators highlight a sharp increase in participation, suggesting that ‘Smart Money’ is grabbing the market and moving more money in than Sellers can move out, even though we remain in Oversold conditions. Sentiment Indicators show that Strong strategic accumulation by ‘Smart Money’ is outpacing Sellers, who appear to have reached the MAX strength of their exit from the market as the Short term Negative Trend cycle grows Stronger and approaches what I would consider peak values. Despite some perceived victories by Sellers, the market has sustained its Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the resilient PVT value. News articles reinforce the changing narrative from MEME to Utility by focusing on technical breakout signals, token burn events, and ecosystem utility developments that further drive investor confidence and hint at incoming HIGHS. However, cautious articles also highlight declining Volume and Sell Walls; this fact-based narrative underscores the market’s obvious challenges and serves to further alleviate FUD/FOMO.

I think the market is at a pivotal moment where the last of the Weak conviction Sellers and the sheer depth of the ‘Sell Wall’ have been exposed. In this strategic moment, ‘Smart Money’ is modestly taking positions while still leaving room for retail investors to participate. We have encouraging Volume combined with breakout signals, and I see Strong Support at the bottom of the market when you consider everything that has influenced us over the past 6 months. After all of that, this is as LOW as the market is going to go. This further affirms that we are almost done with Consolidation and that the market is nearly poised for a breakout in appreciation. Be on the lookout for ‘Black Swan Fakeout Events’, where the market might run sideways in Consolidation after a pullback. This will look like a quick, volatile spike in price followed by a return to this price level. That is not the scenario I see happening, but I like to keep you aware of all possibilities. In essence, I am implying that you should keep your stop losses in place to protect your gains.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the expected stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ where we have tested our LOW Support range. At LOWEST, the market is going to try to test the full breadth of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. I will put out the 2nd Target BELOW this BOTTOM; however, due to ‘Smart Money’ moving so strategically, it is very unlikely that we will reach the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.0001220. That would, however, constitute a market TRUE BOTTOM where we would need to start assessing what is going wrong. At MAX, we are on a path to regain the Neutral zone of our Short  and Long term market, which lies between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This would constitute a 1st Target to recapture that zone, then the market will look to take the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. As a bonus, the next Target beyond that is the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.0001500.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection wednesday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. looks like smart money has moved through about the last of the sell wall with weak conviction sellers exiting as the price takes one last dip. the accelerated pace of the sell wall convinced smart money to rapidly take those positions in response, rather than allowing volatility to drive the price higher and become exit liquidity for hacker laundering and weak conviction sellers. this strategy has lured out the majority of the remaining sellers in the long term cycle. momentum indicators show oversold conditions for the sellers holding weak levels of control over multiple time frames. trend indicators signal that despite the weak pullback into a pessimistic consolidation, the price is hovering at the ichimoku clouds low band while still remaining within the cloud, confirming the consolidation of the downtrend. bollinger bands appear to be increasing in value, which would normally signal consolidation in line with our ichimoku cloud reading, but i can see a bubble of breakout strength growing from this increase. adx values continue to reveal average trend strength while the price is firmly below the supertrend and all emas, indicating a lack of price action. volatility indicators continue to support the breakout signal from the bollinger band contraction, with volatility staying in the neutral of our norms range. price movements continue to place pressure against the low volatility bands, showing the markets attempts to break out and return to the neutral range established by those bands. volume indicators highlight a sharp increase in participation, suggesting that smart money is grabbing the market and moving more money in than sellers can move out, even though we remain in oversold conditions. sentiment indicators show that strong strategic accumulation by smart money is outpacing sellers, who appear to have reached the max strength of their exit from the market as the short term negative trend cycle grows stronger and approaches what i would consider peak values. despite some perceived victories by sellers, the market has sustained its long term positive trend cycle, as evidenced by the resilient pvt value. news articles reinforce the changing narrative from meme to utility by focusing on technical breakout signals, token burn events, and ecosystem utility developments that further drive investor confidence and hint at incoming highs. however, cautious articles also highlight declining volume and sell walls this factbased narrative underscores the markets obvious challenges and serves to further alleviate fudfear of missing out. i think the market is at a pivotal moment where the last of the weak conviction sellers and the sheer depth of the sell wall have been exposed. in this strategic moment, smart money is modestly taking positions while still leaving room for retail investors to participate. we have encouraging volume combined with breakout signals, and i see strong support at the bottom of the market when you consider everything that has influenced us over the past 6 months. after all of that, this is as low as the market is going to go. this further affirms that we are almost done with consolidation and that the market is nearly poised for a breakout in appreciation. be on the lookout for black swan fakeout events, where the market might run sideways in consolidation after a pullback. this will look like a quick, volatile spike in price followed by a return to this price level. that is not the scenario i see happening, but i like to keep you aware of all possibilities. in essence, i am implying that you should keep your stop losses in place to protect your gains. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is resting at the expected stall range within the wall of support where we have tested our low support range. at lowest, the market is going to try to test the full breadth of the wall of support down to the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001270. i will put out the 2nd target below this bottom however, due to smart money moving so strategically, it is very unlikely that we will reach the 38.2 retracement of our 4week low at 0.001220. that would, however, constitute a market true bottom where we would need to start assessing what is going wrong. at max, we are on a path to regain the neutral zone of our short and long term market, which lies between the neutral major pivot point at 0.001360 and the 38.2 retracement of our 4week high at 0.001330. this would constitute a 1st target to recapture that zone, then the market will look to take the 38.2 retracement of the 13week low at 0.001390. as a bonus, the next target beyond that is the 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001500. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to

2025-04-30 03:10:02,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good evening everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, my area received an intense storm, and it's not confirmed yet whether there was a tornado in it or not, but it was a chaotic day nonetheless. It brings me a sense of peace and back to normal getting to the analysis again.

Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ is still holding against the ‘Sell Wall’ and have begun to smooth the rate of change in their favor, gaining a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators highlight the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure building. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This means Bearish Consolidation. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction with Volatility values falling yet staying WITHIN the Neutral of our norms range. The price's implied stability holds just BELOW the Volatility Bands, which further supports the Bollinger Bands' early signal of breakout pressure building as the price will look to reach back within those Volatility Bands acting as Support and Resistance levels. 

Volume Indicators signal increasing participation with ‘Smart Money’ now beginning to move more money into the market than is being moved out by Sellers. Sentiment Indicators reveal the strength of ‘Smart Money’ accumulation holding at Strong levels, and though we see a Short term Negative Trend cycle, they have further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles remain optimistic, highlighting token burns, technical analysis that supports price appreciation, and coverage of ecosystem achievements as they continue to cover the evolution from MEME to Utility. News offers few negative insights but did use Neutral articles that contain fact-based insights to continue helping alleviate FUD/FOMO while offering realistic caution for challenges associated with this asset class in general.

Seeing as this continues to follow a basic dynamic of a ‘Shakeout’ phase, I see that the Indicators are showing the weakness of the ‘Sell Wall’ beginning and the strength of our ‘Smart Money’ taking control of the market. We will likely continue through a Bearish Consolidation phase where I see us begin to level out and run sideways for a little bit before continuing a new positive Trend cycle of price appreciation.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This is roughly the Neutral ground for the current market where price movements would expectedly stay between the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 down to that Short term at $0.00001330. At MAX, the price will break out and continue up to the next retracement level at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. The thing is we lack ‘Price Action’ currently; I wouldn't expect us to reach the next retracement level but potentially just to break over the 2nd level pivot point and reach a stall zone where the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages converge at $0.00001410. After that, the market would assess the next direction. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and test the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ with the potential to make it into a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001320. If somehow we breach that level, we're just going to head to the next retracement lower than that at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 at LOWEST based upon the participation of ‘Smart Money’ currently.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-28 19:41:57,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

As I suspected, the Buyers have a tedious task shaking out the Sellers from the ‘Sell Wall’ as they continue to accumulate at a steady pace, counteracting the Sell pressure. Momentum Indicators show the Neutral ground developing as ‘Smart Money’ Buyers smooth the rate of change over multiple time frames, yet the ‘Sell Wall’ is so large that Sellers remain in a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are behaving as they did previously, moving in small incremental values that neither firmly outline a breakout nor a breakdown but support an outlook of Consolidation. ADX values signal an increasingly Bullish Trend strength holding the price NEAR the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, verifying the lingering resilience of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators provide greater clarity to the Bollinger Bands and support the Consolidation outlook, with Volatility remaining in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, further confirming Consolidation and the Downtrend pressure placed against the LOW Bands.

Volume Indicators show increased participation, meaning that the current price level is an attractive entry point for dip buying. Despite the massive size of the ‘Sell Wall’, for now the money flow is Weak, with more money moving out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’, yet ‘Smart Money’ Buyers have cut that level in half with the increased level of accumulation. This counteracting pressure has begun nurturing and building Strong Support in a newly emerging Neutral Trend cycle. Despite the counteracting pressures, we remain in a Long term positive Trend cycle, with Sellers barely making a dent in the Support built by ‘Smart Money’. News articles continue the Bullish narrative shift from MEME to Utility with coverage of token burns and Strong technical indicators that support the outlook of an incoming rally and gains. While remaining fact-based to counter FUD/FOMO, the News cautions about hacker laundering issues as part of the massive ‘Sell Wall’, reminding investors of the realistic challenges ahead.

I see this as the dynamic it is, and so we are still experiencing that ‘Shakeout’ phase as part of ‘Base Building’. The Indicators highlight some mixed signals, but overall, due to the clear negative counterbalance, we are likely to continue to experience further Downtrend pressure as we test the LOW Support channels. Most likely this will lead to Consolidation, as we have such Strong Support built through these LOW price levels due to ‘Smart Money’ accumulation.

Long term Support and Resistances show the price testing the ‘Wall of Support’, resting just ABOVE the 1st Target LOWEST Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, we will seek the 2nd Target LOWEST at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. Breaking this level establishes the 3rd Target LOWEST at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220, which becomes a more CRITICAL BOTTOM price level for the market to approach. 1st Target MAX will be to reclaim the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001390. This price point also aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. 2nd Target MAX rests at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001500.

2025-04-27 20:03:47,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This ‘Base Building’ phase is becoming quite interesting, as ‘Smart Money’ only needed to sit on the sidelines in a wait-and-see phase to shake out the Weak Longs and Short Sellers. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are holding on the sidelines, grabbing positions from Sellers at a LOW but stable rate, while the market shakes out Weak conviction and presses Short Sellers through the ‘Sell Wall’. This Bearish Consolidation has reached Oversold yet only gives Sellers an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation. However, when you look at the Bollinger Bands, they give an early signal of breakout pressure building as the Bands are contracting sharply. ADX values show Strong Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while still remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. This supports the Bearish Consolidation and reveals resilient underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the early breakout signal from the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices falling BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands highlight the outlook of Bearish Consolidation following a pullback, and in this dynamic the price will seek to return to this range, which further supports the early signal of breakout pressure building.

Volume Indicators also support this outlook as Short term participation is increasing rapidly, meaning that ‘Smart Money’ is grabbing these positions in the Downtrend at a stable rate. Yet there is quite a bit of ground to work through, as Sellers have moved the market into an Oversold position with more money flowing out than in. Sentiment Indicators are predictably showing the Strong distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’ and the strength of the Short term negative Trend cycle. However, when you look at the PVT value retaining that Strong Bullish positive Trend cycle, it implies that this is a temporary pullback. News articles continue the narrative outlining the change from MEME to Utility by covering large token burn events and technical signals that support incoming HIGHS and explosive gains. New keeps a fact-based narrative that helps counter FUD/FOMO by highlighting the obvious large ‘Sell Wall’.

The thing is, the market seems to be in a strategic position following measurable dynamics. I would expect some Short term weakness through this Bearish Consolidation phase while ‘Smart Money’ continues to accumulate and shake out the Weak Longs from the ‘Sell Wall’. This could be a tedious process, but that will only ensure greater stability for the recovery Uptrend to come. This dynamic step is called the ‘Test and Shakeout’ phase. I'm happy that the next dynamic phase is the true breakout phase, so keep an eye on Volume surges and prices that begin closing ABOVE some of our Resistances, which will signal the end of the next phase of accumulation. But what's really nice is the ‘Markup’ phase that follows; I'll leave that to your imagination until we get there, as I will explain it in more detail then.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are holding WITHIN the Neutral zone at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which is acting as our Short term Neutral major pivot point. Our market is getting ready to move into ‘Target’ dynamics and Strong ‘Price Action’, so I will break this down by 1st Target and 2nd Target, MAX and LOWEST. 1st Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. 2nd Target MAX will be the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. 1st Target LOWEST will be the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. 2nd Target LOWEST, also constituting the current market BOTTOM, is at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. Interestingly, this market BOTTOM is not the true CRITICAL level mathematically, but hitting it would still be significant. Don't worry, though, because what it would take to move to CRITICAL levels is like a major global catastrophe, a type of event that shakes out the whales with nerves of steel.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-26 16:04:17,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are continuing to grab everything that the ‘Sell Wall’ lets go of through the dips, and are sustaining an Uptrend cycle. Momentum Indicators show that as the price appreciates further, the rate at which Sellers continue to offload (just as we approach their price level) is creating an opportunity for ‘Smart Money’ Buyers to take these positions and smooth the rate of change to a Neutral level while exerting and taking even greater control of the market in the Short term. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, placing pressure against the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, highlighting a Bullish Consolidation phase with building breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and our Long term EMAs, while showing the 12-Day EMA to be a level of Support/Resistance. This continues to highlight active ‘Price Action’, though. Volatility Indicators support the Bullish Consolidation of the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements continue to hold WITHIN the Volatility Bands while placing pressure against the HIGH Bands to support an outlook of Uptrend continuation and Bullish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators show reduced participation from investors, yet that pullback is beginning to slow down. Despite the ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, the ‘Sell Wall’ has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong levels of distribution from Sellers, leading to Neutral Short term pressure, yet ‘Smart Money’ accumulation was enough to further strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle and cultivate an Uptrend breakout. News articles are shifting focus with an even more Bullish narrative for Shiba Inu, using headlines that forecast explosive moves supported by technical indicators and ecosystem upgrades such as the Shibarium dApp store. News shows some of the hurdles from the resistance barriers and shifting leadership signals, inviting a balanced perspective that continues to help mitigate FUD/FOMO while still acknowledging SHIB's Utility potential.

In the way I'm looking at these Indicators, it appears as if we're starting to see Momentum and Volume begin to falter due to a lack of Buy support. In the Short term, we'll see Sell pressure dominate the Volume, which will lead to a Consolidation phase or a minor pullback toward Support prices. This will pick up Buyers in the dips, leading to a renewal of the breakout Uptrend. This is an actual industry dynamic, which is referred to as an ‘Accumulation Phase’. I like to call it a ‘Base Building Phase’ because of how I see things in my mind; but unlike Bullish Consolidation, the ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in during pullbacks, and our dips aren't being viewed as weakness but rather as attractive entry points that reinforce the underlying Uptrend over the Long term. Some of my favorite investors and analysts use a Wyckoff framework, and this behavior of the market fits that dynamic perfectly.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting at a Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. We have confirmed the market's preference for retracement levels. At MAX, the market will attempt to capture the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520 as the 1st target. To extend that, in the event of a continued breakout, the 2nd target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. At LOWEST, following the retracements, the price will pull back to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. To continue on, a 2nd target breakdown would extend the LOWEST potential to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection saturday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. buyers are continuing to grab everything that the sell wall let us go of through the dips, and are sustaining an uptrend cycle. momentum indicators show that as the price appreciates further, the rate at which sellers continue to offload just as we approach their price level is creating an opportunity for smart money buyers to take these positions and smooth the rate of change to a neutral level while exerting and taking even greater control of the market in the short term. trend indicators signal that the price is within the ichimoku cloud, placing pressure against the high band, while bollinger bands continue to expand, highlighting a optimistic consolidation phase with building breakout pressure. adx values indicate average trend strength holding the price above the supertrend and our long term emas, while showing the 12day ema to be a level of supportresistance. this continues to highlight active price action, though. volatility indicators support the optimistic consolidation of the bollinger band expansion, with volatility rising to the high end of our norms range. price movements continue to hold within the volatility bands while placing pressure against the high bands to support an outlook of uptrend continuation and optimistic consolidation. volume indicators show reduced participation from investors, yet that pullback is beginning to slow down. despite the smart money accumulation, the sell wall has begun moving more money out of the market than in. sentiment indicators reveal strong levels of distribution from sellers, leading to neutral short term pressure, yet smart money accumulation was enough to further strengthen the long term positive trend cycle and cultivate an uptrend breakout. news articles are shifting focus with an even more optimistic narrative for shiba inu, using headlines that forecast explosive moves supported by technical indicators and ecosystem upgrades such as the shibarium dapp store. news shows some of the hurdles from the resistance barriers and shifting leadership signals, inviting a balanced perspective that continues to help mitigate fudfear of missing out while still acknowledging shibs utility potential. in the way i am looking at these indicators, it appears as if were starting to see momentum and volume begin to falter due to a lack of buy support. in the short term, well see sell pressure dominate the volume, which will lead to a consolidation phase or a minor pullback toward support prices. this will pick up buyers in the dips, leading to a renewal of the breakout uptrend. this is an actual industry dynamic, which is referred to as an accumulation phase. i like to call it a base building phase because of how i see things in my mind but unlike optimistic consolidation, the smart money is stepping in during pullbacks, and our dips are not being viewed as weakness but rather as attractive entry points that reinforce the underlying uptrend over the long term. some of my favorite investors and analysts use a wyckoff framework, and this behavior of the market fits that dynamic perfectly. long term support and resistances indicate that we are resting at a short term neutral major pivot point at the 38.2 retracement of our 13week low at 0.001410. we have confirmed the markets preference for retracement levels. at max, the market will attempt to capture the 50 retracement of our 13week highlow at 0.001520 as the 1st target. to extend that, in the event of a continued breakout, the 2nd target would be the 38.2 retracement of the 13week high at 0.001640. at lowest, following the retracements, the price will pull back to the 38.2 retracement of the 4week high at 0.001360. to continue on, a 2nd target breakdown would extend the lowest potential to the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001290. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.7826929509174079,POSITIVE

2025-04-25 19:13:57,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are plowing through the ‘Sell Wall’ and are now accumulating at an aggressive pace. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are capturing the Short term market and scooping up positions as they have increased their levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, attempting to break out, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand and highlight a Short term Bullish Consolidation of the gains. ADX values show Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are attempting to place pressure on the HIGH Volatility Bands, further supporting a Bullish Consolidation and giving an early signal for breakout continuation.

Volume Indicators highlight the ‘Sell Wall’ quite well. Despite reduced levels of participation, more money is flowing into the market than out, and the market is held at a strength just below Overbought conditions, which means that a few participants are contending with this massive ‘Sell Wall’ as if it is nothing. Sentiment Indicators reveal that the few Buyers in the market are aggressively accumulating at Strong levels, massively dwarfing the levels of distribution from the Sellers and elevating the market further into a positive Long term Trend cycle. News articles remain optimistic, with a Bullish Utility narrative covering explosive burn rates, technical breakouts, and ecosystem upgrades. The News also cautions about the massive resistance Sell barrier and covers internal development team warnings, but overall these headwinds provide a balanced counterpart that helps alleviate FUD/FOMO with a fact-driven outlook.

We have a Bullish technical setup with Strong Buy pressure and active ‘Price Action’; however, with the Volume headwinds becoming so resilient, the market may be vulnerable to shallow pullbacks. I see, for now, Sentiment and whale accumulation will continue maintaining the Uptrend cycle through short Consolidations.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360. This 4-Week retracement level shows us that the price is ABOVE a Neutral zone and is looking to continue retracing averages. At MAX, the current pressure can sustain the price up to the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. At LOWEST, the price will fall BELOW the Long term Neutral major pivot point WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-24 19:48:13,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We pulled back as expected to a Short Consolidation phase, which opened up a Buy opportunity for investors in the dip. Momentum Indicators signal that, despite some profit-taking and Buyers entering a wait-and-see phase, the dip allowed Buyers to maintain a Weak level of control in comparison to the Sellers’ participation. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a Bullish signal, and when we combine this with the contraction of the Bollinger Bands, we get an early indication of breakout pressure building following a Bullish Consolidation. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price trades ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, verifying active levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains in the Neutral of our norms range. Price stability holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, along with increasing averages, supports Bullish Consolidation and the potential for breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators reveal increased Short term participation, which means that dip Buying is occurring despite the LOW level of activity. However, overall, Sellers and profit-taking moved more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution from profit-taking Sellers, which in the Short term has overtaken the rate of accumulation from Buyers, creating a new emerging negative Trend cycle. Despite this Consolidation, the Buyers were able to sustain the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increasingly positive PVT value. News articles remain Bullish, with reports of token burns, breakout signals, and optimistic price targets that continue to strengthen the positive narrative and highlight the evolution from MEME to Utility. There are articles highlighting headwinds such as ‘Death Cross’ warnings and a major correction, but overall these narratives are geared toward continuing to mitigate FUD/FOMO through fact-based insights, which only reinforce investor confidence.

I see the market at a crossroads where, on one hand, we have some clear Bullish signals of ‘Price Action’, yet on the other hand, underperforming headwinds are developing due to Buyers losing Momentum as they gauge the market for clear direction. I think this crossroads creates an opportunity for Buy Volume to increase and revive Momentum, but we need to be aware of the Consolidation phases, as the market will likely continue running sideways until everyone gets an idea of what direction to go instead of just providing exit liquidity for a Sell Wall.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is basically aligned with the Long term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001350. Given the tightness of this range, prices could become quite volatile and move in either direction. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At LOWEST, the price is going to reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. Because this market could go in either direction, I will extend the range to a TOP breakout beyond MAX to be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. The BOTTOM, past the LOWEST breakdown, would be the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

Buyers are growing more and more Bullish and beginning to chip away at the Sell Wall, but profit-taking seems to be cooling the market as the counteracting pressure is leading to Consolidation. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are increasing their positions over multiple time frames without reaching Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, but given the attraction of the price to that HIGH Band and the continued expansion of the Bollinger Bands, this confirms a Bullish Consolidation phase. ADX values reveal Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming resilient levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising even further into the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements remain well ABOVE the Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators signal reduced participation, yet the few that are buying are counteracting a massive Sell Wall and continue to move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong levels of accumulation greater than the profit-taking distribution, which has flipped the Long term negative Trend cycle and established a positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the positive narrative by covering ecosystem milestones, burn events, and breakout signals that seem to further the shifting from MEME to Utility. At the same time, there are cautions regarding technical Resistances and ecosystem warnings that work to temper FUD/FOMO by using fact-based analysis.

We are continuing to run Bullish and Buyers are showing greater levels of control while the Sentiment remains very positive. Despite some of the Volume headwinds, if you have been following along with my process, Sentiment accounts for 49.84% of price movement and Volume only accounts for 14.33%. I anticipate that the market will run through a Consolidation phase and may pull back a little, but as we pick up new Buy Volume, this will sustain the Uptrend cycle and prevent a Strong pullback.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is in a Neutral zone, pressed between the Long and Short term Neutral major pivot points, in a range from $0.00001360 down to $0.00001290. At MAX, the price will pick up some Volume and sustain positive Sentiment, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. Breaking ABOVE this level, our next target would be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540. At LOWEST, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels and reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. If we fall BELOW this level, the depth of pullback would be the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001150.

2025-04-22 20:02:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I'm really glad we had this Uptrend cycle because I was excited to watch the dojis play out through the charts, and encouragingly, we have higher HIGHS and higher LOWS. We need to approach this with some caution, though, and breaking it down through the Indicators will help understand a little better what is happening and what we can expect. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers began stepping in, but the stable appreciation was consistently met with profit-taking over multiple time frames, leading to a Weak, Neutral level. Buyers hold a fair amount of control of the market, yet they are chipping away at a ‘Profit-Taking Sell Wall’. Trend Indicators showed that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which outlines our Bullish Uptrend, yet Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, signaling Bullish Consolidation when the two are combined. ADX values signal an Average level of Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning we currently have a robust level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the Neutral end of our norms range. Sustained price movements ABOVE the Volatility Bands support an outlook of pressure building for a Consolidation of gains.

Volume Indicators highlight increased levels of participation, which have kept an even level of counteracting pressure against the profit-taking, leaving money flow at a near-Neutral level, yet more remains flowing in than out. Sentiment Indicators revealed that Buyers are continuing to accumulate at stronger levels than the distribution of profit-taking, which continues to nurture a positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet the profit-taking continues to lend further strength to the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the decline of the PVT value slipping even further today. News articles were overwhelmingly Bullish with Sentiment for Shiba Inu, with projections of drastic moves, breakout patterns, and technical indicators which are driving a narrative of a substantial rally incoming with the additional, continued shift from MEME to real world adoption and Utility. They have isolated articles with cautions, but these continue to show the ongoing effort to counter FUD/FOMO by using fact-based insights to help investors stay attentive to market dynamics.

The Trend is clearly Bullish and Buyers are gradually taking greater control of the market, but Volatility continues to remain LOW and, to me, that indicates a Consolidation phase. We continue to have breakouts from some of our Bands, which supports further gains, but Volume at Neutral means that we should expect to continue testing higher Support levels with temporary Consolidations and minor pullbacks. Any surge in Volume would help confirm the market environment for some of the more cautious investors waiting on the sidelines.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is currently testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to follow the 4-Week retracement path up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. As we are BELOW this level, I won't consider this our MAX; rather, it would be the market's attempt to capture a Short term Neutral major pivot point. I see a scenario of Consolidation where there's a defined stall range that I noticed, with the 18-Day moving average resting at $0.00001420 and the 18-Day moving average just BELOW it at $0.00001400. I would say that our MAX would be the height of that stall range, which converges with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. If we breach this level, we will confirm the 13-Week retracements and establish the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540 as the next MAX target. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. If this triggers a stronger pullback, it would fall down to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection tuesday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. i am really glad we had this uptrend cycle because i was excited to watch the dojis play out through the charts, and encouragingly, we have higher highs and higher lows. we need to approach this with some caution, though, and breaking it down through the indicators will help understand a little better what is happening and what we can expect. momentum indicators show that buyers began stepping in, but the stable appreciation was consistently met with profittaking over multiple time frames, leading to a weak, neutral level. buyers hold a fair amount of control of the market, yet they are chipping away at a profittaking sell wall. trend indicators showed that the price is above the ichimoku cloud, which outlines our optimistic uptrend, yet bollinger bands are beginning to expand again, signaling optimistic consolidation when the two are combined. adx values signal an average level of trend strength holding the price above the supertrend and all emas, meaning we currently have a robust level of price action. volatility indicators support bollinger band expansion, with volatility rising to the neutral end of our norms range. sustained price movements above the volatility bands support an outlook of pressure building for a consolidation of gains. volume indicators highlight increased levels of participation, which have kept an even level of counteracting pressure against the profittaking, leaving money flow at a nearneutral level, yet more remains flowing in than out. sentiment indicators revealed that buyers are continuing to accumulate at stronger levels than the distribution of profittaking, which continues to nurture a positive trend cycle in the short term, yet the profittaking continues to lend further strength to the negative trend cycle, as seen by the decline of the pvt value slipping even further today. news articles were overwhelmingly optimistic with sentiment for shiba inu, with projections of drastic moves, breakout patterns, and technical indicators which are driving a narrative of a substantial rally incoming with the additional, continued shift from meme to real world adoption and utility. they have isolated articles with cautions, but these continue to show the ongoing effort to counter fudfear of missing out by using factbased insights to help investors stay attentive to market dynamics. the trend is clearly optimistic and buyers are gradually taking greater control of the market, but volatility continues to remain low and, to me, that indicates a consolidation phase. we continue to have breakouts from some of our bands, which supports further gains, but volume at neutral means that we should expect to continue testing higher support levels with temporary consolidations and minor pullbacks. any surge in volume would help confirm the market environment for some of the more cautious investors waiting on the sidelines. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is currently testing the wall of resistance, attempting to follow the 4week retracement path up to the 38.2 retracement of our 4week high at 0.001360. as we are below this level, i will not consider this our max rather, it would be the markets attempt to capture a short term neutral major pivot point. i see a scenario of consolidation where there is a defined stall range that i noticed, with the 18day moving average resting at 0.001420 and the 18day moving average just below it at 0.001400. i would say that our max would be the height of that stall range, which converges with the 38.2 retracement of our 13week low at 0.001420. if we breach this level, we will confirm the 13week retracements and establish the 50 retracement of our 13week highlow at 0.001540 as the next max target. at lowest, the price will pull back to the 50 retracement of our 4week highlow at 0.001290. if this triggers a stronger pullback, it would fall down to the long term neutral major pivot point at 0.001240. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.9278605631552637,POSITIVE

2025-04-21 19:49:34,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We entered into Consolidation as expected, but it was quite encouraging to see Buyers step into the dip, meaning they were waiting along the sidelines for entry. Momentum Indicators show that this price stabilization is contending with profit-taking as Buyers lead the market in Weak control over multiple time frames through Bullish Consolidation. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding, confirming the Consolidation. ADX values show Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Long term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 12-Day EMA. This signals Trend continuation and highlights stable ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising near the Neutral zone but still in the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are falling near the LOW of our Volatility Bands, remaining WITHIN their range and further supporting Consolidation.

Volume Indicators offer some encouragement by showing increased participation from investors entering the market through the dips and smoothing the flow of money, leaving a Neutral level with barely more continuing to move in than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation through the dips while nurturing the Short term positive Trend cycle; yet despite the dip buying, profit-taking has lent even more strength to extend the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the PVT value decline even further today. News articles remain Bullish while using technical indicators, token burns, and reversal patterns which continue to reshape the narrative from MEME to Utility. At the same time, they offer caution with signals like scam warnings, potential traps, and Bearish price predictions which work to ease FUD/FOMO by offering fact-based insights.

I can see that Buyers are edging in and the price is sitting comfortably near our Support levels while Volatility remains subdued, and all this is characteristic of Consolidation before a breakout. However, Short term Volume headwinds remain and I can see us continuing with gradual gains where the market might retrace to some of our LOW Band boundaries before establishing a solid breakout. This is an interesting moment.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This acts as our Short term Neutral major pivot point and, given that we are following such defined price dynamics, we may press a little bit lower to test the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which would be the test of the full Neutral range from Short to Long term. At LOWEST, the price will touch the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ and cross BELOW the 9-Day moving average at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. As before, if we breach this level, we would immediately go down to a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150. At MAX, the price will continue to try to reach that next 4-Week retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290, and this would be the market's attempt to establish a higher Short term Neutral major pivot point. Extending beyond this point would mean that the next test would be our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360.

2025-04-20 19:54:35,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The sustained Bullish Uptrend is stimulating Buyer activity in an attempt to get ahead of some of our Volume headwinds in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that, despite the profit-taking, there is sustained Weak Buyer control over multiple time frames, holding the market just ABOVE some Short term Neutral benchmarks. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands have contracted even further today, which signals a growing outlook for breakout potential to test higher Resistance levels. ADX values show that Trend strength is increasing, while prices are holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, signaling that ‘Price Action’ remains stable. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling even further into the LOWEST end of our norms range. Price movements continue to ride AT or ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, supporting a Bullish Consolidation outlook while also lending a Weak signal to the breakout potential that continues to build up.

Volume Indicators show Weak levels of increasing participation, which is encouraging as these investors are accumulating at greater levels than profit-taking is distributing. This further moves more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to signal increasing levels of Strong accumulation, with Buyers continuing to nurture a Short term positive Trend cycle. Despite this Buyer activity, profit-taking has given more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle, as indicated by the PVT value further declining. News articles continue with a Bullish narrative covering token burns, strategic Shibarium updates, and Bullish price forecasts that evolve the coverage from MEME to Utility asset. While there are highlights of technical barriers, high concentration risk, and some scam warnings, they all help counteract FUD/FOMO while cultivating a positive Long term outlook.

Overall, the Indicators and general Sentiment remain positive and point to a Bullish outlook. The Neutral/mixed Volume signals continue to warrant caution, and I would expect a Consolidation of the gains while we proceed through a Bullish Consolidation phase until Volume increases validate a stronger Long term Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price has breached the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and is attempting to follow the retracement path of the 4-Week levels, but it has run into a stall range as indicated by the convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic, which has reached 80%, at $0.00001250. At MAX, the price will attempt in the Short term to reach that benchmark 50% retracement level of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to around the previous 38.2% retracement level of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230 for a Short term Consolidation to test market direction. Falling BELOW this level would trigger a test of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the defined stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where our 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

2025-04-19 20:35:54,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We have a mixed landscape of pressures converging in the market, lending support to the Uptrend following a Short Consolidation as investors gauged the market. Momentum Indicators highlight these resilient pressures by showing Buyers increasing control of the market over multiple time frames, smoothing the price movements into a Bullish Consolidation range. Trend Indicators show the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold the same level of breakout potential from yesterday. ADX values are signaling increasing Trend strength through the Short term, while price movements hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This confirms that Buyers have activated stable levels of ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range. The Bullish Consolidation is well defined, with price movements placing pressure against the HIGH Volatility Bands and supporting the outlook of breakout pressure building. Volume Indicators have fallen to a Neutral level of participation, which creates a little bit of a headwind in the market. Despite the pullback and participation favoring Sellers, the counteracting Long term accumulation is grabbing those profit-taking positions and moving more money into the market than out.

Sentiment Indicators reveal that, despite the Sellers’ participation, Buyers are accumulating at a stronger rate than Sellers are distributing. This convergence of Buy and Sell pressure has led the market into a Neutral ground where the Long term negative Trend cycle has nearly been negated but is currently left at a Weak level, which is quite manageable for the market to work back through. News articles paint a Bullish picture with Strong technical signals, breakthrough price levels, and strategic developments that are steering the narrative from a MEME to one of Utility. News appears to be purposefully crafted to alleviate FUD/FOMO by grounding forecasts with factual insights, signaling a genuine shift in Sentiment.

Mixed yet encouraging signals confirm that an Uptrend is intact, yet the underlying Bearish pressures could still trigger a Short term pullback. Given these mixed signals, I see the ‘Price Action’ carrying us through Consolidation levels while the market attempts to overcome the Weak Short term Volume headwinds and break Resistance levels down to provide higher levels of Neutral Support.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230, resting WITHIN the Neutral zone ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. As before, at MAX the price will attempt to reach the next milestone retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will reach down into the ‘Wall of Support’ at a well-defined stall range where the 3‑Day, 10‑Day, and 16‑Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

2025-04-18 20:14:13,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, it's obvious that we are testing the 4‑Week retracement levels in an attempt to establish higher Neutrals ABOVE Resistance prices, but I don't see an external catalyst, meaning that this is an internal dynamic and I will assess based on clustering. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers step forward and trigger a stable rate of profit-taking as the price appreciation tests the Sell Wall. This Weak level of Buyer control over multiple time frames is already beginning to show signs of being Overbought. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are contracting again, hinting at further breakout potential. ADX values support the outlook of a Consolidation of the gains, as Strong Trend strength in the Short term holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs for a Weak active ‘Price Action’ phase. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction outlook of breakout potential, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range, while price movements are ABOVE the Volatility Bands, confirming Overbought conditions.

Volume Indicators signal Weak levels of participation despite the Strong price movements, while profit-taking contends with Buyers entering the market, moving more money in than out at a positive but near‑Neutral flow rate. Sentiment Indicators are showing Strong accumulation with a newly emerging positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet it is a Long term caution to note that profit-taking at current levels is still enough to have strengthened the Long term negative Trend cycle that the market has yet to fully claw back through and contend with. News articles show stable Long term optimism, with the Bullish narrative using expert forecasts, ecosystem upgrades, initiative progress, and technical signals supporting recovery. News continues its positive influence while painting the picture of a changing recognition for Shiba Inu from MEME to Utility, while using the same Short term Volatility cautions as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

I don't want to follow the general consensus and would like to just look at this in a purely technical way, because I think that, for me, it makes more sense with the elements coming together. We see a Strong Uptrend cycle being confirmed in the Momentum and Trend Indicators, while the price trades ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, EMAs, and the Supertrend, and all of this is converging ABOVE the Bollinger, Donchian, and Keltner Bands. In literal terms of classification, I call this a Consolidation breakout, but we have Volume remaining Neutral, so I'm not sure how much further we can sustain the breakout, as Bullish continuity is especially important ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. I think we need to see Long term accumulation and an improvement in OBV, MFI, and CMF values from our current levels to cultivate a positive Trend cycle of Buying activity. Putting all this together, it shows me that most likely we will Consolidate the gains at some point and may have some Short Uptrend cycles, but without an external catalyst and higher levels of Buyer activity stepping forward to support the Uptrend, it will eventually just peter out over this weekend.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is WITHIN the ‘Wall of Resistance’ just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of our 4‑Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the retracement path up to the 50% retracement of our 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will retreat and test the ‘Wall of Support’, with the critical level resting at the 3rd‑level Support pivot point at $0.00001130.

Despite the increase in Buyer activity, it was not quite enough to catalyze the market for a sustained Uptrend, and the market has returned to a Consolidation phase. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buyer activity remains Neutral in the Short term, resulting in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. This behavior confirms the Consolidation phase. ADX values indicate that the price is moving with Average Trend strength, hovering just ABOVE the Supertrend and around the EMA levels, which now form a very tight Resistance range. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation, as Volatility remains at the Neutral of our norms range. The Volatility Bands reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators are showing declining participation, which suggests ongoing profit-taking. When we examine money flow, it is clear that more money is now flowing out of the market than into it after reaching Resistance levels.

Sentiment Indicators confirm a pullback with Strong distribution in the market. Despite the profit-taking, Buyers appear to have cultivated an emerging positive Trend cycle that has reduced the strength of the Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by the PVT value moving to a Neutral level. News articles offered a renewed Bullish outlook for the Medium and Long term by covering breakout levels after the Consolidation. News articles paint a Bullish narrative, highlighting expert predictions, technical signals of strategic whale accumulation, and token burns. The same cautions of Short term Volatility remain as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO, but overall the News is still changing the narrative from MEME to ‘Utility’, which is a more fundamental encouragement in comparison to just alleviating psychological pressure by using facts. 

There are some signals of Bullish recovery showing through Momentum and Short term Trend Indicators. However, with the lingering Long term Sell resistance against Uptrends with profit-taking, it is likely that the market will continue Consolidating until an external catalyst stimulates ‘Price Action’.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180 and is resting within the Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to a critical level at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001100.

2025-04-16 20:39:35,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We’re right about where we've been over the past couple of days: holding in a sideways Consolidation phase testing both the Support and Resistance ranges. Momentum Indicators show increases in profit-taking, yet only show Sellers coming out with Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase, while Bollinger Bands are doing as they did a few days ago and are increased by a value of 1. This indicates a crossroads of Bearish or Bullish Consolidation, but still continues to hint at breakout potential. ADX values indicate that the current price is moving with resilient, Strong Trend strength extending into the Long time frames, while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend but ABOVE our 12-Day EMA. Though we have some Buyer activity in our dips, we remain BELOW our Long term EMAs, revealing the lack of ‘Price Action’ in the current market. Volatility Indicators seem to support breakout potential, as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, while price movements are beginning to place pressure toward the HIGH Volatility Bands. This further seems to support breakout potential.

Volume Indicators signal a small increase in investor participation through both Short and Long term time frames, yet profit-taking has led to more money flowing out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators now reveal Strong levels of distribution, lending more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle. New articles continue to highlight technical catalysts and a Long term Bullish bias, using expert forecasts of substantial gains. Despite the Long term narrative of appreciation expectations, the Short term narrative highlights the same Volatility possibilities but uses these articles to urge the use of stop losses and ways to gauge the market through technical signals rather than emotion. Seems that even in a Consolidation phase, the News continues to play an avid role in alleviating FUD/FOMO. 

These charts show me that we're in a position to shift towards Bullish Consolidation, but as Supports and Resistances are holding so firmly, this would only serve to test those levels again before reversing to a Bearish Consolidation. I see hints of Bullish Volatility and Long term Volume accumulation hiding beneath the surface, but these are not yet at a current level that could reverse or catalyze the market. It seems that we are at a crossroads and should expect continued Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached back up to capture the Neutral zone, resting at the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001190. At MAX, we will reach back up to try to test the old faithful 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will reach down and test the ‘Wall of Support’ until popular Indicators start showing Oversold conditions and present a Buy opportunity in a dip where the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001120 would constitute a Support BOTTOM.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-15 20:19:41,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I find the interplay of our persistent Short Selling, being moderated by pockets of Buying Sentiment, to be fascinating. It is a true tug-of-war that unwittingly keeps market dynamics within healthy ranges. This is far from a dull Consolidation phase. ""My mission is to kill time, and time’s to kill me in its turn. How comfortable one is among murderers."" Momentum Indicators reveal Oversold conditions, yet the activity from Short Sellers entering the market was counterbalanced by investors Buying the dips. Sellers maintain Weak control of the market across multiple time frames because profit-taking and Short Selling are occurring in tandem. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bearish Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, giving an early signal of breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Strong Trend strength while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This price level confirms the Bearish side of Consolidation. 

Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are BELOW the Volatility Bands, signaling a potential reversal benchmark. Volume Indicators continue to show participation that is slowly increasing on a daily basis as investors grab the dips and move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to show Strong levels of accumulation, although at a reduced rate compared to the past few days. This Short term pullback has passed Oversold conditions, and the Short term Trend cycle is emerging negative. This negative Trend cycle was Strong enough to pull the market from its Long term positive position in what I would otherwise consider a Neutral position; however, based on current values, it is technically a Weak negative Trend cycle.

In a way, I appreciate the role of Short Sellers in keeping the market active. It is like rooting for the antiheroes. Their rapid participation exerts pressure on the market in both directions, allowing for a quicker response to dips that retrace to appreciation over Short intervals. This gradual depreciation does not discourage investors. Instead, it encourages dip buying by demonstrating that the market remains active without ‘Price Action’. I do not expect us to reach critical price levels of Support. In the Short term, we will continue to trade BELOW our Indicator Supports until a catalyst emerges and Buyers become more aggressive, at which point a rebound scenario would see prices closing ABOVE Indicator Resistance levels to signal the start of a recovery phase. Until that occurs, expect a continuation of the Consolidation phase.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is currently resting at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point, at $0.00001180. The critical level of Support is more clearly defined today; at LOWEST, the price could reach the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001110. Just a little extra insight: should we breach our critical level, the Oversold crash price is mathematically projected to occur when the 14-Day RSI falls to 30%, at $0.00000870. BELOW this absolute worst case, the price could collapse to $0.00000350 when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20%. At MAX, the price will need to recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point, which is now located roughly in the same position as the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, at approximately $0.00001220 to $0.00001230.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-14 20:00:30,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

There is an interesting scenario developing in the charts where the current market is testing an extended Neutral range during a Consolidation phase. Essentially, what we are seeing is that the calm before the storm remains in place. However, underneath are some intriguing market dynamics that will be covered through the various Indicator Classes. Momentum Indicators show that Neutral ground has developed. Buyers did not exit the market; instead, pressure from profit-taking increased over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Consolidation phase. An interesting observation is that the Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as they were over the past two days but are expanding at a rate of 1 value per day. This pace does not invalidate breakout potential; rather, it signals Consolidation. ADX values still show elevated Short term Trend strength. Although I classify this as a Bearish condition, it is weakening because the pressure is not Strong Sell pressure. The price has fallen BELOW the Supertrend and our Short term EMAs but remains ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, indicating a resilient yet Weak ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion since Volatility has entered the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continuing to stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands further confirm Consolidation. Volume Indicators highlight a small increase in participation over both the Short and Long term, while money flow is slowly increasing from Oversold levels. In fact, more money continues to steadily flow into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal continuing Strong accumulation. The Trend for the Short term is emerging as a very Weak positive cycle that remains near Neutral. Despite this Consolidation, a small increase was added to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to use technical analysis to highlight critical potential breakout areas and cover the rising burn rates. This increasingly Bullish Long term narrative emphasizes positive ecosystem updates and analyst projections that favor price appreciation and recovery. Despite the overwhelmingly positive coverage, these articles also present a balanced outlook by addressing Resistance levels and investor pain points as negative nuances of Volatility. Such insights help offset FUD/FOMO. 

Overall, these Indicators are encouraging. The main takeaway is that an external catalyst tends to drive inherently volatile markets. If an external event occurs that stimulates investor confidence in a broader context, the price will explode in appreciation from its current levels. This is especially notable given how stable the market has been and how resilient it has remained in the face of declines. I do not wish to put my foot in my mouth, but there has been a healthy underlying resiliency that is valuable in its own right. At some point, we will have to break out of this Consolidation phase, yet it is hard to tell when and in which direction we will move, given how long we have held sideways ‘Price Action’. The charts show a wait-and-see phase continuing into medium time frames, meaning that the market could go in either direction based on either an external catalyst or an internal catalyst such as whale movements, which could cause either a breakout or a breakdown. Earlier, a patron remarked that “Nothing” is happening, and that is a good way to put it because nothing appears to be happening on the surface while so much is occurring underneath.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is AT the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which lies WITHIN the Neutral range between the ‘Wall of Support’ and the ‘Wall of Resistance’. This further supports the Consolidation outlook. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with our first test being just below the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. The next level above this would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price is already near its LOWEST Support levels in the Long term, and this ‘Wall of Support’ is well defined. Falling WITHIN it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. If I calculate this mathematically, then the LOWEST BOTTOM price before reaching a CRITICAL level would occur where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%, at $0.00001140.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

In the past, it is apparent to me now that I didn’t cover the breadth of potential for the market so I will lay out my thesis and make a case for multiple scenarios based on my personal methodology so maybe we can get some more accuracy in comparison to the SHIB analysis process I use to teach you all.



The 1st thing we will do is look at the chart over multiple time frames to establish some basics.



https://preview.redd.it/u00kwmhjiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=8529e22fa52b658eaa66125918d604b4124c3dc3



Here we are pulled out over the lifespan. This takes each candle as 1 day. In this view we can start to see our defined level of Support at $0.00001220. Next observation is to notice the previous phases and cycles being established within the price line. As well we can determine the chart pattern and also the candlestick patterns that developed and how the market dynamics played out.



Now we need to look at more of the current section of the Long term timeframe



https://preview.redd.it/xvhmvfwliaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=475563c11e7e11329082bdd996af7981b3fd7dd9



1. 1st main cycle with dynamics is right around March 2023 and we got Credit Suisse, USD weakness. This follows dynamics until we get into the area I have in red. 



(RED) May 2023 we got US debt ceiling, and then China turns Bearish from June - July 2023. UST curve begins flattening out August 2023. Israel/Gaza in October 2023.



1. Now we get to 2nd main cycle with dynamics and this aligns with FED moves from November 2023 through February 2024



So now we see how the external factors begin to shape the cluster and that we can verify the cycles will follow dynamics



Lets get even closer on the Long term



https://preview.redd.it/hrt42qpniaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=be3a9e94839e93dc55c823715297ef62870cdfdc



By using our previous Full cycle we can establish Fibonacci levels to understand some of what happened and what to expect as we move through different regions For starters the market experienced a full retracement cycle to 100% so that is the period where we get

\-Japan March 2024- through May 2024

\-France Election June 2024

\-Equity Rout July 2024

\-FED August 2024 through September 2024

\-China Eases a bit in October 2024

\-US Elections November 2024

\-China continues easing up through December 2024

\-US Tariffs January 2025 through April 2025



We now connect the external factors to further validate the market structure. A full retracement is an immediately bad experience…sure. BUT it implies a level of reversal where Sell pressure is at the weakest strength. Look what we now have aligning. The 100% retracement level, the long term level of Support at $0.00001220, and price movements respecting these boundaries.



Now we need to get a look at a Short timeframe to begin to see the current market structure in a more volatile (more time per candle) price line



https://preview.redd.it/dbwuylqpiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=985977f7c70ac7a98956d1084639821c0223d775



Now that we are in the 4 hour timeframe, right off the bat, I can see an Elliott wave cycle following the most immediate trend cycle following our current timeframe. After a market completes a full Elliott wave cycle we are in a new trend. Looks like we have to get closer to the current time frame

https://preview.redd.it/3y4461nwiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b812685c91b1e3b7dccfc811eac8a67107336e



Short time frames show that the current trend is experiencing higher HIGHS and higher LOWS after respecting the Long term Support zone. Let’s get closer



https://preview.redd.it/qqcx72kyiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0380eb9d5bec019393e79295fd97a1d8f9b1a8f8

  


To start I know a new phase is a base building phase and that can be tedious so we look for the next phase and we follow the Trend to our past few days out and we see 2 distinct areas that show equilibrium between the top wick off the candle and the bottom wick. This is interesting because the length of this matching pressure doesn’t fit what looked like what would be a double top. This implies ‘Smart Money’ and there are specific dynamics for that.



Is this price line going up? Down? Sideways?



It starts up, then comes down and then we get accumulation while running sideways and the price takes a smooth turn down rather then sharp. Next we get a quick ramp in Buyers which is shown on the candle as a bottom wick growing from the candle. This happened and then a sharp downturn. That’s a shake off, there is accumulation and consolidation and now a new trend starts to develop.



Now we have an idea that we are declining, there is accumulation and consolidation… this is a Shakeout phase and we now know where we are in this new cycle. Let’s go hit the indicators to support our positioning. For this kind of validation we need Volume support to show an increase in participation.



https://preview.redd.it/ax3tcjt0jaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=3959f259e3dfbdb588d3a93f08e1f0ef0ceaa2e5



Over a Long term view we have confirmation of the New phase and also the Shakeout phase all the way through to the new Breakout Initiation Phase. AND that means just like it sounds. Where? Near the 100% Fibonacci…reversal…remember. Also, we validate Long term Support levels and this allows us to move on to our on DD for intrinsic value based on the ecosystem and yada yada whatever you’re in it for basically and to see your margin of safety level.



A Breakout Initiation is followed by a Markup (Uptrend) phase. Again it is what it sounds like. Now we know we got to setup some tools to get a standard idea of the future.



https://preview.redd.it/80y52ds2jaye1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=e26408329c2310b1d3e770b20c290f8061ef1bc2



Here we apply our Trend lines and micro Fibonacci where we see a convergence of expected Resistance lying at the $0.00002330 to $0.00002090.



My estimate for this is to use ATR to determine the extreme move for the current Breakout Initiation phase



$0.00000091 x 3 = $0.00000273 that constitutes an extreme move potential



$0.00001360 + $0.00000273 = $0.00001633. 1st Support Target



Then transition to Markup phase gets another ATR extreme move = $0.00001906 2nd Support Target



Markup Phase gets another extreme ATR move = $0.00002179 3rd Target Support



We now have justified a price range from $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 from Now until the END OF JUNE.



Lowest Potential is to reach back down to the Long Term Support level at $0.00001220.



This is tedious to make into a tutorial/thesis style analysis but I am glad that it was requested because this was fun either way.



Hope this helps you all begin to see the current potential through my eyes and how I apply my other methodologies in a very generalized way to show you all a price projection! ENJOY!

2025-06-02 03:35:17,Reddit,pepe,"🐸🗿 Pepe and Kek: The Meme Gods Behind the Coin 
Hey degens! I’ve been diving deep into the history of Pepe and Kek, and I thought I’d share some fascinating lore that ties this frog-themed revolution to ancient mythology—and why it’s perfect for memecoins like $PEPE.

⸻

📜 What’s the Deal with Kek?
	•	Gaming Origins: “Kek” started in World of Warcraft as a translation of “LOL” from Horde to Alliance players. It became an inside joke among gamers for laughter—and then the internet took it to a whole new level.
	•	Meme Culture: On forums like 4chan, “Kek” evolved into a symbol of meme magic, the idea that memes could influence real-world events.

⸻

🐸 Pepe the Frog: From Comic to Meme Legend
	•	Original Character: Pepe started as a laid-back frog from Matt Furie’s Boys Club comic in 2005.
	•	Internet Takeover: 4chan and other forums adopted Pepe as the ultimate meme template—Sad Pepe, Angry Pepe, Smug Pepe, you name it.

⸻

🤯 The Cult of Kek: When Memes Meet Ancient Mythology
	•	Ancient Deity: Here’s where it gets wild—Kek is also an ancient Egyptian deity representing primordial chaos and darkness at the dawn of creation. In Egyptian mythology, Kek is often depicted as a frog-headed god, or sometimes as a man with a frog’s head.
	•	Role in Creation: Kek and his female counterpart, Kauket, symbolized the boundless darkness that existed before the world was formed. They were part of the Ogdoad, a group of eight deities representing the fundamental forces of the universe in ancient Egyptian religion.
	•	Symbol of Transformation: Frogs in Egyptian culture often symbolized transformation and rebirth, thanks to their metamorphosis from tadpole to adult—a fitting parallel to the way memes evolve and spread!

⸻

🤑 Pepe, Kek, and Crypto
	•	Meme Magic: The internet hilariously connected the dots between Kek the Egyptian god and Pepe the meme frog. Thus was born the “Cult of Kek,” where Pepe is seen as the modern-day avatar of Kek, channeling meme magic into the world (and sometimes into markets).
	•	Memecoin Spirit: Pepe-themed coins like $PEPE tap into this mythos, making “In Lord Kek we trust” a rallying cry for the community. It’s all about that chaotic, transformative energy that memes bring to crypto.

⸻

⚡ Why It Matters

This mythology reminds us that memes aren’t just jokes—they carry symbolism, history, and cultural significance. In a world where internet culture and crypto overlap, the Kek–Pepe connection is the perfect embodiment of that meme magic energy that brings us all together.","frog moai pepe and kek the meme gods behind the coin hey degens! i have been diving deep into the history of pepe and kek, and i thought id share some fascinating lore that ties this frogthemed revolution to ancient mythologyand why its perfect for memecoins like pepe. scroll what is the deal with kek? gaming origins kek started in world of warcraft as a translation of lol from horde to alliance players. it became an inside joke among gamers for laughterand then the internet took it to a whole new level. meme culture on forums like 4chan, kek evolved into a symbol of meme magic, the idea that memes could influence realworld events. frog pepe the frog from comic to meme legend original character pepe started as a laidback frog from matt furies boys club comic in 2005. internet takeover 4chan and other forums adopted pepe as the ultimate meme templatesad pepe, angry pepe, smug pepe, you name it. exploding head the cult of kek when memes meet ancient mythology ancient deity here is where it gets wildkek is also an ancient egyptian deity representing primordial chaos and darkness at the dawn of creation. in egyptian mythology, kek is often depicted as a frogheaded god, or sometimes as a man with a frogs head. role in creation kek and his female counterpart, kauket, symbolized the boundless darkness that existed before the world was formed. they were part of the ogdoad, a group of eight deities representing the fundamental forces of the universe in ancient egyptian religion. symbol of transformation frogs in egyptian culture often symbolized transformation and rebirth, thanks to their metamorphosis from tadpole to adulta fitting parallel to the way memes evolve and spread! moneymouth face pepe, kek, and crypto meme magic the internet hilariously connected the dots between kek the egyptian god and pepe the meme frog. thus was born the cult of kek, where pepe is seen as the modernday avatar of kek, channeling meme magic into the world and sometimes into markets. memecoin spirit pepethemed coins like pepe tap into this mythos, making in lord kek we trust a rallying cry for the community. its all about that chaotic, transformative energy that memes bring to crypto. high voltage why it matters this mythology reminds us that memes are not just jokesthey carry symbolism, history, and cultural significance. in a world where internet culture and crypto overlap, the kekpepe connection is the perfect embodiment of that meme magic energy that brings us all together.",0.8564520310610533,POSITIVE

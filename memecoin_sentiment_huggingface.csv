2025-05-23 06:14:10,Reddit,doge,"I made an hourly prediction market game for crypto and just added DOGE/USDT cuz why not. Would love some feedback on it! What's good y'all.

The game ([https://cryptosplit.io](https://cryptosplit.io/)) has been a fun project for me, and I released it some days ago for people to check out. The way it works is you bet site coins on BTC, ETH, and DOGE markets going UP or DOWN every hour.

If you win, you get your coins back + a proportion of the losers' pool based on how much you bet and how big the pools are: essentially, it's just pool betting but for hourly crypto.

It's a pretty straightforward concept, and I'm looking for people to try it out and see if it's something that they'd like to play and compete in against their friends/randoms. 

Moreover, it's not your typical crypto game where you play-to-earn. Rather it's tournament-based. So, you'd make bets through a competition period (say like 6 hours where you come in and out every so often) and if you have the most coins at the end you'd win cash/crypto/something (idk yet, and the tourneys would be free to play to start for sure).

2025-05-24 00:17:44,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Arrived home a short while ago from a business trip, and Tulsa roads SUCK! Looks like I missed an underwhelming ‘Reaccumulation’ test, where it appears ‘Smart Money’ was checking on the strength of our previous rally. There are some signs of institutional profit-taking, but investors absorbed quite a bit of the supply around the solid Support rather than triggering a reversal. Momentum Indicators reveal a Weak Neutral ground for the market, with Buyers asserting a Weak level of control over multiple time frames. This implies some profit-taking because if it were a Trend reversal, then Sellers would be in control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show the price is falling BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a position of Consolidation, which is confirmed by looking at the expanded Bollinger Bands as well. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength holding the price WAY BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels. We're not so far BELOW the 200-Day EMA that it signals a breakdown, but that ‘Price Action’ is simply paused. Volatility Indicators give a little bit of a mixed signal, with Volatility remaining elevated, meaning the price will move with greater fluctuation in either direction. With the price being WAY BELOW the Volatility Bands, we can look forward to a potential price stabilization in the Short term, as the healthy basic price dynamic is to move WITHIN those Support/Resistance channels. 

Volume Indicators signal increasing participation on the bounce, which is encouraging as money flow holds at a Neutral level and reveals HIGH levels of money moving out of the market in comparison to the underlying ‘Smart Money’ stabilization. Sentiment Indicators show Strong levels of distribution from profit-taking, which emerges as a very Weak Short term negative Trend cycle, but the ‘Smart Money’ is strategically placing pressure against the market, and this is acting in our favor, as seen by the increased PVT value highlighting a Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles were increasingly Bullish with their coverage of major Shibarium updates and continued the Utility narrative by highlighting whale activity, our HODL investors, and massive token burns. Articles outlined the Short term challenges of prices being BELOW key averages and warned of negative historical Trend behavior during the Q2/Q3 quarters, but these all continue to help calm FUD/FOMO and simply balance optimism.

There is a majority of the Indicators that seem to show that ‘Smart Money’ took some profits and quietly reentered around Support. When you look, you can see that Volume kind of tapered off during the depreciation and began increasing as the price bounced off the LOW, which shows Buyers absorbing supply. The order book shows a deeper Buy side near the Support, which confirms that ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in. I was serious when I urged patience, no FUD/FOMO, and HODL because this is a temporary pullback. Basically, from here we just want to see the Support HOLD and Buy Volume keep increasing. From our current position of Weak Bearish, we want to move to Neutral and then eventually to Bullish territory. As we rise into Bullish territory, that's going to be our signal that the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase is done and that the FULL ‘Markup’ phase is ready to go.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that prices are already bouncing off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 2nd standard price deviation. This should be about the LOWEST point, so I don't see it going any lower, because that ‘Wall of Support’ has been tested THOROUGHLY. At MAX, prices are going to reclaim Neutral ground just BELOW the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH, which acts as the TOP of the Neutral range at $0.00001480. Once we can regain that higher Neutral level, then we're going to move back into Targets and take back our Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500. From there, Bullish territory would put us at 1st Target MAX at nearly the TOP test of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001650.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-22 21:00:25,Reddit,shiba,"ANTI FUD/FOMO Analysis - Context and Expectations (POST ATTEMPT #2) This is my forward-looking analysis of the current Trend cycle, using my methodologies to provide a basis of understanding and set expectations that can give the SHIBArmy insight into our investment. Other cryptos have their unique community caveats, but SHIB will have the WISEST investors! We’re in this together….so let’s look at it the same way, together!

Recently, I covered the current market using part of my technical and fundamental methodologies to clarify this asset’s movements, which, in my earnest opinion, have become textbook examples. I plan to save these analyses and charts for the rest of my life. So far, we have identified the dynamic cycle as the “Reaccumulation” phase following a “Base Building” phase. I have conducted a Long term analysis and justified a price range of $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 by the end of June. We now need to further clarify the market’s movements because simply labeling each day as “Consolidation” can be misleading without context. In line with my analysis findings, I will explain how the market should behave within that price range and how long that behavior might persist.

I love Fibonacci Retracements because they provide immediate context when I look at the charts; they reveal where the market is and what it can do. Currently, we are resting just below the 23.6% retracement level of our ATH.

https://preview.redd.it/1vdc5js3de2f1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=6835d47182c1f2508e46e7db4eb956e4f187aff5

Looking at the MONTHLY view, we find ourselves in a familiar position that we can use for reference. Let’s move into Short time frames. The previous “Reaccumulation” appears to be around September of 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/rdaxv6h5de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae0a1c6e5a88621dccbde918c94d0e3cece3304

We seem to be in a similar position as that September 2024 phase, so we need to gauge how long this dynamic should play out.

https://preview.redd.it/dyhgj087de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=f895f1cf94b3ed4c3f2fe24b15daf338e7a27b1f

I estimate roughly 65 days (about two months) for a “Reaccumulation” phase before the “Markup” phase begins. Let’s take a closer look at that previous ‘Reaccumulation’. From my view, it occurred between the 23.6% and the 38.2% retracement levels. Now I have context and clearer expectations.

https://preview.redd.it/m9n812n8de2f1.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=31785ebbd1067e8e13f093fe500a203a0434e481

Where were the price movements? Well, from this view I can see that the ‘Reaccumulation’ occurred WITHIN the 23.6% and the 38.2% retracement levels. That’s context and expectation.

What is the 23.6% retracement level, you may ask? It is a rapid Support zone where Buyers step in almost immediately to defend the level and drive price appreciation. We see LOW Volatility, as if the market were taking a breather, which appears as Consolidation. Did that happen during the 2024 Reaccumulation? Obviously! Price movements ran sideways and were choppy, ranging from $0.00001370 at the start of the phase to $0.00002160 near the HIGH of building pressure. That Uptrend pushed the price into the ""Decision Zone."" That is where investors take profits and create a solid level of Support WITHIN the range between the 2 retracement levels. Our Support building between the 23.6% and 38.2% levels is special because it aligns in textbook fashion with the ‘Reaccumulation’ dynamics of ‘Smart Money’. Now we have deeper context and expectations. Let’s look at the current cycle’s position.

https://preview.redd.it/cr954m7ade2f1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc067821d31c45de114a25f9091af08ee2a6a56

This chart displays the current dynamic using an overlaid 21-Minute timeframe. Based on this view, I can tell that around June 2, 2025, we should find ourselves above the 23.6% retracement level and expect some Consolidation before establishing a Support level BELOW the 38.2% retracement level, all ahead of the ‘Markup’ phase.

Over the next 2 weeks, build your positions. DO NOT FUD/FOMO; HODL! Remember that SHIB is moving in a defined manner. The more wisdom you have as an investor, the more safety you can apply to your positions. I have provided a timeframe, price ranges, and a detailed breakdown of the current market’s movement dynamics.

If you look at my chart, can you see what I see? In the last cycle, we climbed ABOVE $0.00003100, and I see the market starting to do something quite positive around mid-April 2025. My analysis indicates that across various Indicator classes, all the data points to the same positive alignment.



Hope this helps!

2025-05-22 20:09:20,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This Uptrend cycle was a nice, expected test of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ as the market looks to establish higher Support levels. Momentum Indicators show the sustained effort by ‘Smart Money’ generated demand, which began driving the price over multiple time frames, leading to the market entering a Bullish, positive Support zone. Trend Indicators reveal the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling the beginning of an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are expanding slightly, which gives an early signal for Consolidation of the gains. ADX values signal Average Trend strength holding the price WAY ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMA levels, meaning a Strong level of ‘Price Action’ is currently being retained throughout the market. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH of our Norms range. Price movements are ABOVE and AT the Volatility HIGH Bands, outlining the market's intent for price appreciation to drive the Uptrend cycle and establish higher Supports ABOVE the indicated Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators highlight increasing participation, signaling that demand is increasing, while profit-taking seems to be the main counter to the current Trend. This is revealed in money flow; a closer look shows profit-taking is moving just a little bit more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ can move in. Sentiment Indicators show this Strong level of distribution from profit-taking, while demand and ‘Smart Money’ further cultivated a positive Trend cycle. PVT saw a small decline, which means that profit-taking did weaken the Long term positive Trend cycle slightly, but overall we remain in an elevated position, as seen by the PVT retaining a HIGH value. There is an increased amount of coverage, with News articles showing a Bullish Long term outlook by highlighting charts displaying technical breakouts, record burn rates, and improving community and whale activities. Cautious articles provided fact-based insights around whale sell-offs and seasonal pressure, but the coverage of the Short term risks helps ease FUD/FOMO while also continuing to reinforce the narrative of sustained development toward Utility.

From what I can tell, we have an intact Trend that is beginning to accelerate. This is a textbook sign that the market is beginning to transition from ‘Accumulation’ into ‘Markup’, and that our ‘Smart Money’ investors have just about solidified their positions; Now our Bullish Momentum will be more pronounced. Be aware of any external catalysts, because these will create a LOT of Volatility REALLY FAST and have a major effect on Volume and order flow as we move forward. Increasing Volume off the bounces provides some confidence in the structure, but we need to keep seeing higher LOWS from those bounces, as that's going to be the signal that the base is fully formed and that the ‘Markup’ phase will be sustainable. I just gave a contextual analysis so that when I say ""right now, expect Consolidation,"" you understand that it's not just a Consolidation, but short breaks on the climb up the mountain.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting just BELOW what I would consider the TOP of the NEW Neutral range, which is going to extend from the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001560 down to the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001470. At MAX, the market will continue testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and breach ABOVE it, where the Oversold level for Short term conditions mathematically is when the 14-Day RSI is at 70%, at roughly $0.00001730. At LOWEST, the market is going to bounce off the BOTTOM of the Neutral zone at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001470. The reason I say that is because we've already fully tested the ‘Wall of Support’ and have established demand ABOVE this, so don't anticipate it to fall back, as demand would currently take that as a MAJOR Buy opportunity and we would bounce right back into the Neutral zone.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-21 19:30:28,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The market is contending with some macro catalysts, and we appear to be in a moment of Consolidation. Momentum Indicators show the market's comfort in the ‘Demand Zone’ as Neutral ground, highlighting a solid base being maintained by ‘Smart Money’ over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud near the LOW Band, highlighting the current Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting during this Consolidation phase, signaling increasing breakout pressure and revealing an underlying Uptrend bias. ADX values reveal Average Trend strength, holding the price AT the Supertrend and EMA levels, giving greater definition to the ‘Demand Zone’ and the market's current attempts to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal increasing Volatility, which further supports breakout pressure building, while also showing that any price movements will have greater fluctuation in either direction. Prices are held WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels, further highlighting the solid base of the ‘Demand Zone’.

Volume Indicators show increasing participation through the bounce, and when we look at the breakdown of money flow, we can see that we currently are at a Neutral level, but looking at it in greater detail shows that profit-taking is moving slightly more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ can move in. Sentiment Indicators reveal the distribution levels from profit-taking, attempting to contend with the Short term positive Trend cycle being cultivated by ‘Smart Money’ and extending into a Long term positive Trend cycle that has increased even further despite the recent pullback. News articles offer Bullish reports of technical breakouts, accumulation trends, and forecasts of huge gains. Long term positive bias continues to cultivate the Utility narrative while offering fact-based Short term insights around whale exits, supply barriers, and price dips, but overall the Short term focus is on easing FUD/FOMO while highlighting Long term institutional support.

Investors are sensitive to macro influences, and this is a simple Consolidation and not Trend rejection! Institutional investors are taking a pause and may be offloading some of their positions to kind of reduce their exposure to some of these macroeconomic risks that are coming into focus. Underlying is a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase where Buyers are slowly absorbing the Sell pressure, which keeps the overall Sentiment Bullish. The price bounced off the Neutral zone, showing that the Supports held firm and set the stage for a renewed Uptrend once the market finishes rebalancing.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the ‘Wall of Support’ and ‘Wall of Resistance’ have contracted, tightening the Neutral range where the price currently rests at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001450. At MAX, the price will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001570. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the midway point of the already tested solid ‘Wall of Support’, down to around the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001430.

2025-05-20 19:45:30,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ has successfully established a solid base for a ‘Demand Zone’. Buyers are showing just enough interest to prevent excessive depreciation, but not enough to drive Momentum toward higher prices. Momentum Indicators reveal the strategic Neutral ground being cultivated by ‘Smart Money’ as they absorb supply in ‘Reaccumulation’. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting a Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as yesterday, retaining the signal for breakout pressure underlying the market. ADX values highlight Weak/Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and ALL EMAs, meaning the market is trying to establish a directional bias. Volatility Indicators define the Bollinger Bands by showing falling Volatility, which supports the outlook of Consolidation. However, with Volatility remaining near the HIGH of our norms range, it signals that increasing price movements will occur in either direction. Prices are holding near the LOW Volatility Bands, indicating that the market is attempting to establish Support and remain within the Neutral ‘Demand Zone’.

Volume Indicators show increased participation, yet a closer look at the CMF reveals that profit-taking has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of distribution as Short Sellers attempt to contend with ‘Smart Money’ accumulation. This balance of pressure is driving demand, evidenced by a new positive Trend cycle developing in the Short term and further strengthening the Long term positive Trend cycle, as shown by the increased PVT value. News articles display a resilient positive bias with highlights of technical breakthroughs and large token burns, with several reports hinting at potential reversals and rallies. They also mention Short term risks such as whale liquidations and heavy outflows, but these fact-based insights help ease FUD/FOMO while steering the narrative toward utilization and revealing Long term institutional support.

Even though the price bounces back to our Support levels, this zone of demand shows that there is acceptance at that level, and these bounces only reaffirm how solid the Support is. Accumulation remains intact as institutional buyers continue to participate cautiously while waiting for Buyer conviction to fully kick in. At this point, we are simply waiting to see Strong Volume on the bounce and higher LOWS for confirmation before a sustained Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001460 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001420. At MAX, the price will test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001680. At LOWEST, the price will bounce off the already tested ‘Wall of Support’, potentially down to the midway point near the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001360.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-19 19:45:41,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ continues to absorb the supply while macro catalysts create some temporary Volatility. Momentum Indicators show a slight pullback; however, when I was reviewing the news and conducting on-chain analysis, I tracked some odd whale activity. It appears that a whale may have been ‘Shaken Out’ during ‘Reaccumulation’, which is rather uncommon, or it might have been a rebalancing move to adjust their position. Either way, ‘Smart Money’ acted strategically and secured a Weak level of control over the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is placing pressure on the LOW Band of the Ichimoku Cloud while resting WITHIN the Cloud, reflecting the recent Bearish Consolidation. In the same period, Bollinger Bands expanded, capturing the Consolidation; however, they now appear to be at their peak and are beginning to contract slowly, giving a very early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values show Average Trend strength, holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all Short term EMAs. The market is attempting to capture the Short term EMAs, suggesting an underlying effort to catalyze ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators lend support to the outlook of breakout pressure building, adding greater definition to the mixed signal from the Bollinger Bands. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels, indicating that the market has successfully locked into Neutral ground following the Bearish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators reveal ‘Shakeout’ activity with reduced participation, and Sellers syncing with the odd whale activity, suggesting that retail investors experienced some FUD/FOMO. A detailed view of money flow shows that more money is still flowing into the market than is being removed by profit-taking, confirming that ‘Smart Money’ is successfully absorbing positions. Sentiment Indicators highlight a quick spike in distribution with a Weak negative Trend cycle forming in the Short term. Despite the pullback, the Long term positive Trend cycle remains intact, though weakened. News articles indicate that the market is finding support through technical bounces and increasing burn rates, reinforcing the Utility narrative. Reports cover Short term risks such as declining burn activity and price drops, but these were fact-based insights meant to help ease FUD/FOMO while offering a realistic view of the market's Long term institutional support.

The price continues to respect Support levels and bounces back into the Neutral zone, which is exactly what we hope to see during ‘Reaccumulation’, and this confirms that ‘Smart Money’ is still working in our favor. I anticipate continued ‘Reaccumulation’, and since the market still holds a Weak Bullish strength overall, we will likely see some incremental scaling. This scaling will allow investors to gauge whether the Volatility is transient or the start of a larger macro economic shift.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is bouncing off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to a defined stall range where the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW converges with the mathematical point where the 14-Day RSI is at 50%, at $0.00001390. At MAX, the price will move upward and begin testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580.

2025-05-18 19:50:06,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We continue to move through ‘Reaccumulation’ with underlying Bullish Sentiment while testing Support, and ‘Smart Money’ absorbs the supply before the ‘Markup’ phase. Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ is increasing pressure while profit-taking attempts to counteract the Uptrend across multiple time frames, leaving Sellers with very Weak control. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Consolidation, yet the Bollinger Bands are expanding and give an early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values indicate an Average Trend strength holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. As the market fluctuates through the EMA range, we can take it as an attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators are falling, which gives a mixed signal to the Bollinger Bands breakout, meaning that price movements will be relatively stable regardless of direction. Price is holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands' Support/Resistance channels while attempting to push ABOVE the HIGH Bands, further supporting the outlook of building breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators signal an encouraging uptick in participation over both the Short and Long term as the price bounces off the Support area we’ve identified over the past few days. Money flow displays elevated strength from ‘Smart Money’ absorbing the supply through ‘Reaccumulation’; a detailed look shows that exponentially more money is flowing into the market than profit-taking can remove. Sentiment Indicators reveal elevated levels of Strong accumulation by ‘Smart Money’, nearly expressing a FULL strength potential. This elevated accumulation further strengthened the Long term Trend cycle, as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles are shifting focus to the Short term market by highlighting positive support from Bullish technical signals, price predictions sounding like the 2021 rally, and a potential SHIB ETF listing that also continues to support the Long term narrative of the move from MEME to Utility. Although some stories caution about LOW burn activity and a sluggish overall crypto market, the fact-based insights help ease FUD/FOMO while providing a realistic view of market conditions. Institutional support remains positive.

From what we have seen over the past few days, our most recent LOW was marked by a ‘Three Black Crows’ candlestick pattern followed by a ‘Hanging Man’ at the BOTTOM of the Downtrend, serving as the visualization of the profit-taking. When I take this with our overall dynamic cycle, it is clear that our LOW highlighted the accumulation zone that ‘Smart Money’ and institutions cultivated. They are absorbing supply while allowing the price to rebound, effectively defending the latest Support level as they build larger positions. This is a clear sign that accumulation is transitioning into an early ‘Markup’ dynamic, as demand is starting to drive the price through less pressured Resistance tests. When the price visits the Support zone, it acts like a healthy little ‘Shakeout’. Retests allow for ‘Reaccumulation’, and the fact that the price falls only to the TOP of the Support averages means we have a cushion. Pullbacks are some of the last opportunities to add to your positions, so follow this ‘Smart Money’ dynamic to make sure you are ‘Reaccumulating’ rather than getting caught in a ‘Bear Trap’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the Neutral major pivot point and the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW. This tightening range is beginning to signal that breakout pressure is building and that the market is about to test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ as ‘Smart Money’ confirms a solid Support. At MAX, the price will test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580. We will focus on our 1st Targets, as this remains a testing range where healthy pullbacks are expected. A 2nd Target in either direction would merely indicate that the market was not comfortable, either pulling back too far to build new Support or extending beyond because it confirmed sufficient Momentum to take off; that scenario would need to be analyzed as a proceeding market dynamic from what we are observing now. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-17 16:03:19,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our retail investors are being triggered by this ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which is leading to some Oversold distribution but not to the extent that it signals a complete breakdown of the Trend. We can confirm that the Support level is genuine, although there is also a sign that Sell pressure still lingers during this healthy ‘Reaccumulation’ phase while Buyers hesitantly step in due to macro influences. Momentum Indicators show that the market is in Oversold territory, with profit-taking pressure capturing control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands begin to expand. This is a signal of a Consolidation following a Support test. ADX values signal that Trend strength is increasing, with the price remaining BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, which means that the market is struggling to generate active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators lend support to the Bollinger Bands' Downtrend Consolidation signal with Volatility falling but holding in the HIGH of our norms range. Price movements are hovering BELOW the Volatility Bands, showing the depth of Oversold territory. There is a tendency for the price to return WITHIN the Volatility channels for Support/Resistance.

Volume indicators highlight reduced participation in BOTH the Short and Long term, highlighting the level of caution in the current market. Money flow is Oversold, yet a closer look at the CMF reveals that more money continues to flow into the market than profit-taking can move out. Sentiment Indicators show stable levels of HIGH accumulation, which is what we want to see to confirm that we are still in a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase rather than sliding toward a breakdown. The CCI indicates that this Sell pressure expressed a FULL strength in the Short term, reflecting the MAX pressure the market could exert toward a negative Trend cycle. In the Short term, we are facing an extremely Oversold negative Trend cycle that is sapping strength from the Long term Trend cycle; however, the PVT value remains elevated WITHIN a solid Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles highlight record burn milestones, a maturing ecosystem, and technical patterns that support the shift from MEME to an asset with real Utility. There was coverage on Short term challenges, such as falling burn activity and market downturns, but these help ease FUD/FOMO while steering the overall narrative toward sustained development. Institutional support remains positive.

Eventually, this phase should lead to a cleaner recovery with increasing Volume. However, if this recovery Trend persists, it may also indicate that institutional support has not fully kicked in yet and that the market might be dealing with a minor distribution before the FULL transition into ‘Markup’. I keep watching the order book dynamics to verify that the spread remains tight and that the depth on the Buy side continues to increase near our LOWS, showing that institutions are continuing to absorb supply even if the price is bouncing in the Short term. Currently, Buy pressure appears to have nearly Overcome the lingering Bearish Sentiment, so I remain patient and am still waiting for the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase to shift into ‘Markup’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is knocking on the expected bounce point at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001440. At LOWEST, the price might extend down to test further WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where we see 2 major retracement levels converging: the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW and the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390. This is an important level of Support because, mathematically, the 14-Day RSI would be at 50% and there is also a convergence where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic would be at 30% at that same price level too. This defined level of Support leads me to believe that we should not see any further significant decline past that point. At MAX, the price will reclaim the Neutral zone and attempt a 1st Target Max at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530. If we can break through that level, the next test would be to challenge the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection saturday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. our retail investors are being triggered by this reaccumulation phase, which is leading to some oversold distribution but not to the extent that it signals a complete breakdown of the trend. we can confirm that the support level is genuine, although there is also a sign that sell pressure still lingers during this healthy reaccumulation phase while buyers hesitantly step in due to macro influences. momentum indicators show that the market is in oversold territory, with profittaking pressure capturing control over multiple time frames. trend indicators reveal that the price is just below the ichimoku cloud while bollinger bands begin to expand. this is a signal of a consolidation following a support test. adx values signal that trend strength is increasing, with the price remaining below the supertrend and all emas, which means that the market is struggling to generate active price action. volatility indicators lend support to the bollinger bands downtrend consolidation signal with volatility falling but holding in the high of our norms range. price movements are hovering below the volatility bands, showing the depth of oversold territory. there is a tendency for the price to return within the volatility channels for supportresistance. volume indicators highlight reduced participation in both the short and long term, highlighting the level of caution in the current market. money flow is oversold, yet a closer look at the cmf reveals that more money continues to flow into the market than profittaking can move out. sentiment indicators show stable levels of high accumulation, which is what we want to see to confirm that we are still in a reaccumulation phase rather than sliding toward a breakdown. the cci indicates that this sell pressure expressed a full strength in the short term, reflecting the max pressure the market could exert toward a negative trend cycle. in the short term, we are facing an extremely oversold negative trend cycle that is sapping strength from the long term trend cycle however, the pvt value remains elevated within a solid long term positive trend cycle. news articles highlight record burn milestones, a maturing ecosystem, and technical patterns that support the shift from meme to an asset with real utility. there was coverage on short term challenges, such as falling burn activity and market downturns, but these help ease fudfear of missing out while steering the overall narrative toward sustained development. institutional support remains positive. eventually, this phase should lead to a cleaner recovery with increasing volume. however, if this recovery trend persists, it may also indicate that institutional support has not fully kicked in yet and that the market might be dealing with a minor distribution before the full transition into markup. i keep watching the order book dynamics to verify that the spread remains tight and that the depth on the buy side continues to increase near our lows, showing that institutions are continuing to absorb supply even if the price is bouncing in the short term. currently, buy pressure appears to have nearly overcome the lingering pessimistic sentiment, so i remain patient and am still waiting for the reaccumulation phase to shift into markup. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is knocking on the expected bounce point at the top of the wall of support at the 1stlevel support pivot point at 0.001440. at lowest, the price might extend down to test further within the wall of support, where we see 2 major retracement levels converging the 38.2 retracement of the 4week low and the 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001390. this is an important level of support because, mathematically, the 14day rsi would be at 50 and there is also a convergence where the 3day and 14day raw stochastic would be at 30 at that same price level too. this defined level of support leads me to believe that we should not see any further significant decline past that point. at max, the price will reclaim the neutral zone and attempt a 1st target max at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week high at 0.001530. if we can break through that level, the next test would be to challenge the full wall of resistance up to the 3rdlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001580. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.5483806785196066,POSITIVE

2025-05-16 19:40:17,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ is continuing to absorb some of the residual Sell supply, but despite some Buyer interest, it is still not Strong enough to push the market into a FULL ‘Markup’. Momentum Indicators signal that Neutral ground is forming from ‘Smart Money’s’ ‘Reaccumulation’, counteracting Sell pressure and leaving Sellers with only an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is just BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Consolidation phase during the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, emphasizing that underlying breakout pressure is still growing. ADX values highlight Weak/Average Trend strength, with the price remaining BELOW the Supertrend and ALL EMAs while attempting to reach those levels; meaning that the market is trying to revitalize ‘Price Action’ and establish a firm Neutral ground. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal of the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility remaining at the HIGH of our norms range. Price movements are holding WITHIN the channels defined by the Volatility Bands, further supporting the current Consolidation outlook.

Volume Indicators signal Neutral Short term participation, while resilient Long term participation highlights solid underlying support. Money flow data is nearly Neutral, but a closer look shows that slightly more ‘Smart Money’ is accumulating. This is bringing more money into the market than is being moved out by Sellers. Sentiment Indicators point to increased accumulation, indicative of a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase. This counterbalancing act between ‘Smart Money’ and profit-taking Sellers is maintaining a Short term Neutral Trend cycle, while the positive Long term Trend remains intact as seen by the resiliently elevated PVT value. News articles hold a mostly positive bias, providing updates on Shibarium upgrades, ecosystem advancements, and Bullish price predictions that reinforce the Utility narrative. Although Short term coverage of challenges from profit-taking linger, reports of lower burn activity, and falling Volume are highlighted in a fact-based way to continue easing FUD/FOMO. Institutional outlook remains encouraging.

I expect the market to have found some comfort around these Support levels until order flow dynamics begin to improve. This Consolidation phase allows ‘Smart Money’ to accumulate more before the ‘Markup’ phase, which is a healthy underlying signal. We are simply waiting for Volume to pick up; once it does, Bullish Momentum will build and we will begin the transition into the ‘Markup’ phase. For now, exercise some patience and wait for Volume acceleration during an Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting WITHIN the Neutral zone between the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH and the Neutral major pivot point. This defined Neutral range is beginning to tighten and converge with other Supports, extending from $0.00001510 down to $0.00001480. At MAX, the market will test the FULL range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001700. At LOWEST, the market will bounce off the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001420 as a Short Support test.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-15 19:56:37,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our retail investors are being triggered by this ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which is leading to some Oversold distribution but not to the extent that it would signal a complete breakdown of the Uptrend. Momentum Indicators signal that the market is in Oversold condition, where profit-taking has elevated Sellers over multiple time frames to Average levels of Bearish control. Trend Indicators reveal the deep extent of how far prices are Oversold, with the price sitting FAR BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, showing that buildup pressure for a breakout is underlying the current Trend. ADX values show Average Bearish Trend strength, holding the price FAR BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. The current market shows a lack of ‘Price Action’ due to the charts indicating EXTREME Overreaction in Oversold territory. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal of the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility remaining at the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are FAR BELOW our Volatility Bands, setting the stage for a rebound as the price works its way back WITHIN those channels of Support/Resistance.

Volume Indicators highlight a Short term reduction in participation, while the Long term picture reveals the ‘Reaccumulation’ cycle that ‘Smart Money’ has cultivated. Money flow data indicates Oversold strength, with the insight from the CMF showing Neutral levels of money flow and a very small edge of positive bias toward ‘Smart Money’s’ accumulation efforts. Sentiment Indicators signal that despite the Strong pullback, ‘Smart Money’ is capturing positions and accumulating at greater levels than Sellers are distributing. When you look at the CCI, you see just how Strong an Overreaction the Sellers have expressed. Despite this Strong Overreaction, the market has retained its position in a Long term positive Trend cycle. News was overall Bullish, with the Long term outlook being highlighted through reports of token burns, whale accumulation, and technical breakouts which continue reinforcing the Utility narrative. Although there is attention on Short term cautions, with Articles covering profit-taking and Short term technical negatives, the broader narrative was focused on alleviating FUD/FOMO while revealing the institutional perception of SHIB and the ongoing ecosystem enhancements.

The market needs to get on a treadmill and work on its cardio because this Long breather is triggering some retail investors; however, the ‘Reaccumulation’ dynamic remains intact. We are still in a Long term Uptrend cycle. Based on the Long term dynamic positioning and the current ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, it is not uncommon to see Bearish pressure pull back to Support levels as ‘Smart Money’ will test different Support levels before stepping up accumulation. Some ‘Smart Money’ appears to have been digesting some of their gains, and this may cause us to continue through this dynamic with elevated caution. I would highlight that this is an opportunity to absorb some of the Sell pressure before this temporary pullback leads to a fundamental Trend reversal, allowing the rest of the dynamic framework to play out all the way to the ‘Markup’ phase. What I am mainly watching for is the point at which Volume begins to decline as the price falls and then picks up on the bounce. That pickup will show that Buyers are absorbing the Volume and taking greater control even if the Sentiment remains Bearish. Price stabilization will mark the area of the bounce.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting just BELOW the Neutral zone, testing the FULL ‘Wall of Support’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530. The market is testing the lower Target range of the 2nd Target LOW from yesterday, which rests at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001480. The ABSOLUTE LOWEST Target price potential before causing a Trend breakdown would be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390; such a level would constitute the failure of Support for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price will follow Targets, with the 1st Target MAX set to capture the Neutral major pivot point at the TOP of the Neutral zone at $0.00001600. If we see a FULL Uptrend reversal, the TOP of that cycle would be to test the FULL ‘Wall of Resistance’ all the way to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001770.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-14 19:53:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Nice little controlled pullback and bounce pattern during ‘Reaccumulation’ that still falls within the dynamic framework we’ve been following. Momentum Indicators signal that the market is continuing to rise from Neutral ground with Buyers taking control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is attempting to break  WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. Currently, AT the LOW Band, this points to the lingering Bearish Consolidation; however, with our Bollinger Bands beginning to contract again, it implies that Sellers have run out of strength and Buyers are slowly lifting the market. ADX values show Average Trend strength with the price still BELOW our Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet we remain ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, signaling that there is still underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal that Volatility remains at the HIGH end of our norms range while price movements stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands’ Support/Resistance channels. This highlights the current Consolidation and the framework WITHIN which the price will attempt to move.

Volume Indicators are signaling increasing participation. Money flow is at an Average strength, but when you examine the details of the distribution, more money is flowing into the market than is being moved out. Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong levels of accumulation at which ‘Smart Money’ is reaccumulating. This strategic participation has added even greater strength to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to show a Bullish outlook with headlines about token burns, price moves, and technical patterns. They do note some Short term signs of profit-taking and Resistance levels, but these fact-based articles help ease FUD/FOMO while showing the shifting institutional narrative toward utilization.

The market is gathering strength by testing Support near the BOTTOM of my algorithm's range and then moving toward Neutral. This reflects an underlying structure WITHIN the cycle that confirms IT IS STILL INTACT. Things are starting to improve gradually and, based on this part of the price structure, we would want to see Volume give us a clear signal that the cycle is ready to push into the ‘Markup’ phase. Rather than simply stating that I expect an Uptrend continuation, which I have expected for the past few days, ‘Smart Money’ will ultimately dictate when this occurs. Volume Indicators are going to provide some of the greatest insights into when Sellers are easing their aggressive counterbalance to the Trend and when the market is ready to move from this temporary Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001590. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 1st Target MAX at the 1st-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001710. At LOWEST, the price will reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which acts as the BOTTOM of the Neutral range at $0.00001530.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-13 19:48:24,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that ‘Smart Money’ has just about finished with the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, having moved through about the last of the Sellers’ supply. Momentum Indicators show the Neutral ground is well defined, with the last of the ‘Sell Wall’ giving Sellers the spotlight and control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, attempting to place pressure against the HIGH Band, which confirms the Consolidation we were experiencing and indicates that breakout pressure is building. We captured the Bollinger Bands at the MAX of the expansion, which means that as the Bollinger Bands contract from this position, breakout pressure will continually grow. ADX values signal an Average Trend strength that elevated the price TO the Supertrend while rising ABOVE ALL EMAs, signaling a more growing level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators show that Volatility remains ABOVE the HIGH of our norms range, and price movements have recaptured the Support/Resistance channels defined by the Volatility Bands. This indicates that the market has reached an area to begin building support and moving through these channels.

Volume Indicators reveal participation levels consistent with the ‘Reaccumulation’ outlook. Money flow data reveals that more money was moved out of the market than in during this Short period, which further supports the intrinsic undervaluation and helps define a greater margin of safety. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution during the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, with these levels surprisingly only lending a Weak level of negative pressure against the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by maintaining the elevated PVT value. News articles address the Short term with a mix of fact-based insights, yet overall the Bullish Utility narrative continues with highlights of whale accumulation, breakout forecasts, and burn rates. They outline the massive ‘Sell Wall’, price loss, and potential liquidation zones to remind investors of the Short term risks, while still providing insights into the levels of institutional support.

We are following proper dynamics and respecting our Support and Resistance levels during the ‘Reaccumulation’ phase, which appears to finally be running the last bit of its course. I anticipate Uptrend continuation as demand is rather HIGH, with ‘Smart Money’ absorbing so much of the supply during this final pullback.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is still WITHIN the Neutral zone, resting ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001600. This psychological level of Support in the Neutral zone has created a very healthy base for price appreciation moving forward. At MAX, the price will begin testing the full range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, with the 1st Target MAX set at the 1st-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001720. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001870. From there, we will attempt to establish Support around the 38.2% retracement of the 52‑Week LOW at $0.00001910, up to the TOP of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001990. At LOWEST, there is so much built-up Support that the price will touch the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001450, but it would only bounce back with ‘Reaccumulation’.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection tuesday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. it appears that smart money has just about finished with the reaccumulation phase, having moved through about the last of the sellers supply. momentum indicators show the neutral ground is well defined, with the last of the sell wall giving sellers the spotlight and control of the market over multiple time frames. trend indicators reveal that the price is within the ichimoku cloud, attempting to place pressure against the high band, which confirms the consolidation we were experiencing and indicates that breakout pressure is building. we captured the bollinger bands at the max of the expansion, which means that as the bollinger bands contract from this position, breakout pressure will continually grow. adx values signal an average trend strength that elevated the price to the supertrend while rising above all emas, signaling a more growing level of price action. volatility indicators show that volatility remains above the high of our norms range, and price movements have recaptured the supportresistance channels defined by the volatility bands. this indicates that the market has reached an area to begin building support and moving through these channels. volume indicators reveal participation levels consistent with the reaccumulation outlook. money flow data reveals that more money was moved out of the market than in during this short period, which further supports the intrinsic undervaluation and helps define a greater margin of safety. sentiment indicators highlight strong distribution during the reaccumulation phase, with these levels surprisingly only lending a weak level of negative pressure against the long term positive trend cycle, as evidenced by maintaining the elevated pvt value. news articles address the short term with a mix of factbased insights, yet overall the optimistic utility narrative continues with highlights of whale accumulation, breakout forecasts, and burn rates. they outline the massive sell wall, price loss, and potential liquidation zones to remind investors of the short term risks, while still providing insights into the levels of institutional support. we are following proper dynamics and respecting our support and resistance levels during the reaccumulation phase, which appears to finally be running the last bit of its course. i anticipate uptrend continuation as demand is rather high, with smart money absorbing so much of the supply during this final pullback. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is still within the neutral zone, resting above the long term neutral major pivot point at 0.001600. this psychological level of support in the neutral zone has created a very healthy base for price appreciation moving forward. at max, the price will begin testing the full range of the wall of resistance, with the 1st target max set at the 1stlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001720. the 2nd target max will be the 2ndlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001870. from there, we will attempt to establish support around the 38.2 retracement of the 52week low at 0.001910, up to the top of the wall of resistance at the 3rdlevel resistance pivot point at 0.001990. at lowest, there is so much builtup support that the price will touch the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001450, but it would only bounce back with reaccumulation. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.7665233882144094,POSITIVE

2025-05-12 19:36:50,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, it looked like yesterday that smart money had absorbed the last of the supply and that Sell pressure was beginning to weaken. I applied my algorithm to the Neutral range instead of the LOWEST, anticipating that we were finally at Neutral ground, but it appears we are NOW in the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’. Momentum Indicators signal that ‘Smart Money‘ is increasing activity at this level, with strength beginning to lift from the Neutral zone while leaving Buyers in control of the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, applying pressure on the LOW Band to reveal the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’. Bollinger Bands are moving by small incremental values again, which means a ballooning breakout pressure. ADX values highlight Strong Trend strength, with the price being held WELL BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet we remain above the 200-Day, signaling active ‘Price Action’ hidden in this FUD/FOMO driven Short Seller Downtrend. Volatility Indicators still reveal that Volatility is ABOVE the HIGH of our norms range, and when prices are WELL BELOW the Volatility Bands, it confirms that breakout pressure is building and that we will eventually return WITHIN those Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ participation is holding back the Weak conviction Short Sellers in the ‘Reaccumulation Zone’ while moving more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong accumulation, with Buyer strength lending a consistent level of positive support to the Long term Trend cycle, as seen by the ever-increasing PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with positive insights that highlight technical breakout signals, forecasts for explosive rallies, and strong whale activity, all fact-based. There are cautions concerning the ‘Sell Wall’ and some Overbought Short term alerts, but these serve to counter FUD/FOMO while still encouraging investors and reinforcing institutional support.

We are still seeing the last of the remaining supply being absorbed by ‘Smart Money’, which continues to set the stage for Uptrend continuation and the ‘Markup’ phase. LOW Volume near a Support test means that we will be seeing a structured price appreciation as our demand grows. Many investors are misreading the market, because we are not seeing any reversal triggers from distribution. Our ‘Reaccumulation Zones’ simply build more energy for the ‘Markup’ phase. Volume rejection at Resistances would signal a Bearish divergence and cycle exhaustion; however, before any MASS distribution occurs, we would see Consolidation or even Redistribution!! It is somewhat amusing to see these Short Sellers get caught in ANOTHER ‘Bear Trap’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001530, which is WITHIN the Neutral zone. This Short term test of Neutral Supports could potentially see the market reach as LOW as the LOWEST Neutral major pivot point at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001450. At MAX, the market will look to retest the ‘Wall of Resistance’ in 3 Target phases. 1st Target MAX is at the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001580. 2nd Target MAX is the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001640. 3rd Target MAX is the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001730.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-11 20:02:32,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These are the early signs that ‘Smart Money’ has nearly finished absorbing our supply while the market rests on a solid Support base before moving into the ‘Markup’ phase at what appears to be a final checkpoint showing institutional investors have capped our Sell pressure. Momentum Indicators show Neutral ground while ‘Smart Money’ continues to reaccumulate during the pause. While maintaining stable levels of control over multiple time frames, our Buyers are setting the stage for the ‘Markup’ phase while providing some of the last chances to accumulate with each pullback. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is resting AT and breaking ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bullish test of Support, while Bollinger Bands support this outlook with expansion that signals Consolidation. Average Trend strength continues to hold the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, while the price occasionally bounces off the Short term EMA to reveal its tendency to accelerate and then calm ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators give additional insight into the Bollinger Bands expansion that signals Consolidation, while also preserving the outlook of a breakout phase that is ballooning in strength as Volatility has risen ABOVE the HIGH end of our norms range. Volatility Bands have caught up to price movements and are supporting the outlook of Uptrend continuation.

Volume Indicators again highlight the early signs of participants’ intended direction for the next phase, as investors are increasing positions in the Short term after a strategic pullback signaled by the Long term values. Money flow in general is at a Neutral level, but when you look at how Buyers and Sellers are influencing this flow, it is clear that more money is continuously flowing in at Strong levels over that which is moving out of the market. Sentiment Indicators support this by revealing continuing Strong levels of accumulation while strategically adding a small amount of strength to the Long term Trend cycle. PVT values reveal that the Long term positive Trend cycle has increased even further due to this activity that others may see as a negative pullback, yet this strategic participation has been a positive catalyst. News articles are showing a Strong Bullish bias lately with reports of increasing burn rates, technical breakout patterns, and timelines showing the shift from MEME to Utility. These articles highlight the strength of the community with very few negative scenarios, while fact-based insights continue to counter FUD/FOMO and underline the institutional support.

We are still following basic dynamics for reaccumulation, and these Short Consolidation patterns are opportunities for the market to catch its breath while allowing institutional ‘Smart Money’ to build larger positions for the next phase. The Short test of demand really helps set up the next breakout cycle; any secondary accumulation does not mean a ‘Markup’ is unlikely, only that if demand continues to outpace supply, we have confirmation for the rally’s continuation. Anticipate Short pullbacks as the market establishes higher Support levels.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is beginning to work its way through the ‘Wall of Resistance’, resting just BELOW the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001640, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. The market will attempt to establish our next Support Target at the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001730. That is a Neutral range where the market will establish solid Support. 1st Target MAX will be for the market to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001910. At LOWEST, the market will reach down to the defined stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001590.

2025-05-10 19:58:51,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This is an interesting pause where the market is catching its breath at a major level of Long term Fibonacci Support before deciding its next move. Momentum Indicators highlight the lingering pressure of profit-taking rising in an attempt to counteract the Buy pressure. Despite the increased Sell pressure, Buyers remain in Strong control of the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Bullish breakout phase. Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract again, giving an early signal that breakout pressure is building. ADX values reveal a steady level of Average Trend strength holding the price WELL ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, which signals a heightened level of underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators further add support to the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGHEST of our norms range. The fact that price movements remain ABOVE the HIGH Volatility Bands confirms the Bullish breakout while respecting the current Consolidation and adds support to the outlook of breakout continuation. This occurs because the Bands are trying to catch up to the price rather than the price retreating WITHIN the Bands.

Volume Indicators are where I take the most interest because this Short term increase in participation signals the direction the market wants to take. We can see that the market is roughly at a Neutral level in terms of money flow, but when you examine how the money is moving, more money is flowing into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators further reveal Strong levels of accumulation during this ‘Distribution’ phase. Although Buyers have not yet expressed the full strength of their potential influence on price movement, they have crossed the Short term Oversold benchmark. This level of ‘Base Building’ activity further elevates the positive value of the PVT and shows that a Strong Long term Trend cycle is being cultivated even further. News articles continue to cover the transformation of SHIB while also maintaining a Strong Bullish bias. They highlight technical breakout signals, explosive token burn rates, and increasing Volumes that support some of the ambitious price targets being set. Although there is plenty of positive insight and institutional support, there remains coverage of the ‘Sell Wall’ and some of the underlying volatile whale dynamics. Overall, these remain fact-based cautions that remind us of the realistic challenges that persist and still help counter FUD/FOMO.

Right now we are seeing a phase of ‘Smart Money’ accumulation during what appears to be a ‘Distribution’ phase. The interesting thing is that this is not a true ‘Distribution’ phase but really a ‘Reaccumulation’ phase. The fact that capital is flowing into the market the way it is implies that Buyers are absorbing the supply even if the price appears stalled. This Consolidation is not a sign of weakness but a strategic repositioning by ‘Smart Money’. The Bullish strength at this point is not just price driven; it is being supported by Strong capital inflows. We have Strong institutional conviction over longer intervals, meaning that a reversal is unlikely in the face of ongoing accumulation. Based on the Indicators, I expect to see a continuation of the breakout as soon as ‘Smart Money’ is done catching its breath and taking positions from profit-taking distribution.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT a defined stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001590. While the market catches its breath, I anticipate that the test of this Long term Fibonacci level will act as our new Support BOTTOM at $0.00001564. At MAX, the price will attempt to test the full range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level pivot point at $0.00001730. At LOWEST, the price will test the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement Support level at $0.00001564.

2025-05-09 19:53:14,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

What an amazing Uptrend cycle! This is my hobby, and I feel like the cast they portray in the movie ‘Twister’, OLD ‘Twister’, and I'm screaming, ""We got one, we got one!"" This is a beautiful dynamic playing out and, based on my methodologies, we haven't seen anything yet. Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ has FULL control of the market with Buyers leading the Uptrend cycle over multiple time frames. These levels are now at the Short term benchmark for being Oversold. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WELL ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Bullish Uptrend cycle. When you combine this with the massive expansion of our Bollinger Bands, it means we will Consolidate the gains, which is exactly what we're beginning to experience. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength over both Short and Long time frames, holding the price WAY ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This signals that the current level of ‘Price Action’ is EXTREME. Volatility Indicators further validate the Consolidation outlook, with Volatility zooming to the HIGH of our norms range. Uptrending price fluctuations are bouncing ABOVE the HIGH Volatility Bands, even further supporting the outlook for Consolidation of the gains.

Volume Indicators fully highlight those first signs of Consolidation, as Volume is at the same level as in the previous Consolidation phase. It is reassuring to see these align because they occur within the proper multi-horizon time frame window to make averages. Despite the Short term Consolidation outlook, ‘Smart Money’ and Buyers are moving more money into the market than is moved out by profit-taking or Seller activity. The nice thing is that this activity is just ABOVE a Neutral value, meaning that Average pace is driving all of this ‘Price Action’. Just wait until it ramps up to FULL strength! Sentiment Indicators show Strong ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, with Buyers entering the MAX potential pressure zone in the Short term and adding positive weight to our Long term Trend cycle. This positive Short term strength has accelerated the PVT back into solid Long term support, as seen by the sharply increased value. News articles are not shy about the Utility narrative and their Bullish Long term bias with highlights of Strong technical breakouts, surging burn rates, strategic whale accumulation, and exciting ecosystem upgrades. All of these factors fuel our Bullish Momentum with very few negative insights. The fact-based approach continues to be the counter to FUD/FOMO, and institutional awareness continues to grow.

I am absolutely thrilled to be witnessing clear staging and dynamic play out in the charts. We are in a transitional stage right now between the ‘Breakout Initiation’ and the ‘Markup’ phase. This aligns with my previous analysis that identified this as the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Looking at this current midpoint Consolidation and early setup for the ‘Markup’ phase, I expect to see a test of the Consolidation channel that will align these levels from my go-to Fibonacci and Elliott Wave analyses. This is a good sign that the Bullish energy from our Buyers is being expressed as they can take a moment to accumulate and begin confidently pushing further. After this pause, which we see as Consolidation, it should not be taken as weakness but rather as a natural part of the dynamic where our ‘Smart Money’ validates there is enough safety before committing to the FULL surge. In my own methodologies, I view this as a ‘Margin of Safety’ for the ‘Smart Money’. This is an intermediate phase that acts as the springboard for price acceleration, so look for Volume to signal that Buyers are overcoming any residual hesitation from the less aggressive investors. That is when you will see the clear characteristics of the ‘Markup’ phase beginning. Pullbacks are minor and accumulations are healthy; these tests just add extra validation for ‘Smart Money’ to drive the price higher toward the next Target. It is as if ‘Smart Money’ is checking, ""Is everybody okay? Is everybody still here? All right, let's go again."" I believe we have a structurally sound dynamic playing out before our eyes, and we should keep expecting a gradual Uptrend followed by an accelerated phase of price appreciation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has broken ABOVE our Target level at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001460. We are hovering near the Long term 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.00001560. This means the Consolidation range should be from $0.00001460 up to $0.00001560. 1st Target MAX will be to finish testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 3rd-level pivot point at $0.00001670. The next Consolidation channel should be from $0.00001670 up to the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001730. From there, the market will look to accelerate to 2nd Target MAX at the 38.2% retracement of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001910. The next Consolidation channel would extend from the mathematical average of the 14-Day RSI reaching 80% at $0.00001980, up to the 50% retracement of the 52-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00002180. We will continue to assess this in stages based on Targets.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection friday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. what an amazing uptrend cycle! this is my hobby, and i feel like the cast they portray in the movie twister, old twister, and i am screaming, we got one, we got one! this is a beautiful dynamic playing out and, based on my methodologies, we have not seen anything yet. momentum indicators show that smart money has full control of the market with buyers leading the uptrend cycle over multiple time frames. these levels are now at the short term benchmark for being oversold. trend indicators signal that the price is well above the ichimoku cloud, highlighting the optimistic uptrend cycle. when you combine this with the massive expansion of our bollinger bands, it means we will consolidate the gains, which is exactly what were beginning to experience. adx values reveal strong optimistic trend strength over both short and long time frames, holding the price way above the supertrend and all emas. this signals that the current level of price action is extreme. volatility indicators further validate the consolidation outlook, with volatility zooming to the high of our norms range. uptrending price fluctuations are bouncing above the high volatility bands, even further supporting the outlook for consolidation of the gains. volume indicators fully highlight those first signs of consolidation, as volume is at the same level as in the previous consolidation phase. it is reassuring to see these align because they occur within the proper multihorizon time frame window to make averages. despite the short term consolidation outlook, smart money and buyers are moving more money into the market than is moved out by profittaking or seller activity. the nice thing is that this activity is just above a neutral value, meaning that average pace is driving all of this price action. just wait until it ramps up to full strength! sentiment indicators show strong smart money accumulation, with buyers entering the max potential pressure zone in the short term and adding positive weight to our long term trend cycle. this positive short term strength has accelerated the pvt back into solid long term support, as seen by the sharply increased value. news articles are not shy about the utility narrative and their optimistic long term bias with highlights of strong technical breakouts, surging burn rates, strategic whale accumulation, and exciting ecosystem upgrades. all of these factors fuel our optimistic momentum with very few negative insights. the factbased approach continues to be the counter to fudfear of missing out, and institutional awareness continues to grow. i am absolutely thrilled to be witnessing clear staging and dynamic play out in the charts. we are in a transitional stage right now between the breakout initiation and the markup phase. this aligns with my previous analysis that identified this as the long term 23.6 fibonacci retracement level. looking at this current midpoint consolidation and early setup for the markup phase, i expect to see a test of the consolidation channel that will align these levels from my goto fibonacci and elliott wave analyses. this is a good sign that the optimistic energy from our buyers is being expressed as they can take a moment to accumulate and begin confidently pushing further. after this pause, which we see as consolidation, it should not be taken as weakness but rather as a natural part of the dynamic where our smart money validates there is enough safety before committing to the full surge. in my own methodologies, i view this as a margin of safety for the smart money. this is an intermediate phase that acts as the springboard for price acceleration, so look for volume to signal that buyers are overcoming any residual hesitation from the less aggressive investors. that is when you will see the clear characteristics of the markup phase beginning. pullbacks are minor and accumulations are healthy these tests just add extra validation for smart money to drive the price higher toward the next target. it is as if smart money is checking, is everybody okay? is everybody still here? all right, let us go again. i believe we have a structurally sound dynamic playing out before our eyes, and we should keep expecting a gradual uptrend followed by an accelerated phase of price appreciation. long term support and resistances indicate that the price has broken above our target level at the 38.2 retracement of the 13week high at 0.001460. we are hovering near the long term 23.6 fibonacci retracement at 0.001560. this means the consolidation range should be from 0.001460 up to 0.001560. 1st target max will be to finish testing the wall of resistance up to the 3rdlevel pivot point at 0.001670. the next consolidation channel should be from 0.001670 up to the 13week high at 0.001730. from there, the market will look to accelerate to 2nd target max at the 38.2 retracement of the 52week low at 0.001910. the next consolidation channel would extend from the mathematical average of the 14day rsi reaching 80 at 0.001980, up to the 50 retracement of the 52week highlow at 0.002180. we will continue to assess this in stages based on targets. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.9806767627596855,POSITIVE
2025-05-08 20:05:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We have finally made it to the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase and the market has confirmed the expression of its full strength by reaching the HIGH set by my algorithm. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers have grabbed the market and are not being shy about pressing full strength against any Seller activity, allowing ‘Smart Money’ to take full control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is well ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is Bullish, but when we factor in the expansion of the Bollinger Bands, they signal an early sign of Consolidation. ADX values highlight Strong Bullish Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a period of active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators add further support to the Consolidation outlook as Volatility remains at the LOW/Neutral end of our norms range, with price movements rising ABOVE the Volatility Bands. This further validates the ‘Breakout Initiation’ cycle while also supporting an outlook for Consolidation of the gains.

Volume Indicators signal some of the first signs of our Consolidation as participation declined in the Short term; however, underneath this is the remnant of Strong Buyer activity, with more money flowing into the market than is moving out. Sentiment Indicators show a Strong level of accumulation, with Buyers adding more positive weight to the Long term Trend cycle. News articles are picking up on the market's movements and continue with the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting Strong technical signals, increasing token burn rates, and rising trade Volumes that signal a Long term cycle of transformation for SHIB and the ecosystem. Although News continues to dominate with Bullish articles, they still use fact-based analysis of technical data to counter FUD/FOMO while highlighting the Short term cautions that are realistic for our market. Positive institutional awareness for utilization is growing!

Now that we have validated the dynamic cycle and can identify this phase as the ‘Breakout Initiation’, we need to understand what happens during this cycle. First, we must expect a Consolidation, and the charts currently show that, which is a healthy feature of this phase. As we go through the Consolidation phase, our ‘Smart Money’ is able to confirm that the Resistance barrier between the accumulation cycle and the ‘Markup’ phase is a firm level of safety. This is technically called a ‘Preliminary Support Test’. Once the price is done testing and there is no reversal following Consolidation, the stage will be set for our ‘Markup’ phase. This will be a series of higher HIGHS and higher LOWS in which ‘Smart Money’ drives the price through brief Consolidations that will serve to verify that the accumulation is effective while the market is transitioning into the Uptrend. In this dynamic cycle, you really want to see increased Volume occurring ABOVE the identified level of Support/Resistance. We are literally on the cusp of liftoff!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has broken ABOVE and is holding our 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. We will be moving according to our Targets; the 1st target acts as initial Support for the current Trend. Since we are expecting a Consolidation phase, the price will go no lower than that 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380, as this would constitute the Short BOTTOM. The well-defined stall range at the convergence of the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages at $0.00001410 would then mark the TOP of the Neutral range for this current Consolidation. Our next Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001460. If pressure expresses itself with increased Volume, the MAX Target of the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase would be to reach the mathematical point where the 14-Day RSI would be at 70% at $0.00001620. From there, we would assess the ‘Markup’ phase, but for now let us focus on this current dynamic cycle to see how far ‘Smart Money’ can express itself.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-07 20:19:45,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like not much has changed in terms of market position other than ‘Smart Money’ accumulating through the dip. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market has returned to Neutral ground with Buyers holding a strategic yet Weak level of control. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Consolidation phase of the current market. Bollinger Bands reveal expansion; to me, this appears as a contraction phase that is ballooning to show a stronger breakout pressure underlying. ADX values signal Weak Trend strength, with the price AT the Supertrend level and working through Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. This reveals the market's attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators signal Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range while price movements began rising through the Volatility Bands to place pressure against the HIGH Bands. This supports an outlook from the Bollinger Bands indicating growing breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators show a Short term pause in participation during the Consolidation phase, while the CMF reveals an increasing rate at which ‘Smart Money’ is taking positions and an increased level of money continuing to flow into the market compared to outflows from Sellers. Sentiment Indicators highlight ‘Smart Money's’ Strong level of accumulation. This heightened level of Buy activity confirms the strength of our Support levels while preserving the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles ramp up coverage of Bullish utilization by highlighting increasingly positive technical signals, huge price forecasts, and strategic ecosystem upgrades. Despite the Long term Support from the Utility narrative, articles offer fact-based insights into whale activity and potential Sell traps that they identify as areas of Short term Volatility. While still helping to alleviate FUD/FOMO, the articles are increasingly encouraging to investors and offer institutional insights.

Dynamics are converging while the market holds in a wait-and-see phase for clearer signals and confirmation from Volume. As the market absorbs the catalyst, we have some underlying cautious Sentiment that will only temper the return to the previous dynamic cycle. As we continue, it will be a little more restrained than our previous expectations, but nonetheless, we are just waiting for the market to catalyze ‘Price Action’ in an extended Consolidation phase.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Neutral zone at the Long term Neutral major pivot point. Since this is an extended Consolidation phase, the Neutral zone extends from the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 down to our previous close price at $0.00001250. At MAX, the 1st Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and touch the Long term Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-06 19:37:57,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I'm just going to come right out and say that I find pre-announcement Consolidations to be absolutely annoying, but I get it. While ‘Smart Money’ waits for the outcome of the FOMC meeting, this high-impact catalyst has caused those traders to reduce their activity, leading to a period of LOW Volume before the market decisively begins moving again. Either way, today gives us insight into the market's sensitivity to event risks and external catalysts. Momentum Indicators reveal that, despite the pullback from Buyers, there was also less Seller activity. That means that the Buyers' reduced level of activity is still holding the market at about the same Neutral position as yesterday. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while placing pressure on the LOW Band, supporting a simple outlook of Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which highlights the buildup of breakout pressure. ADX values signal Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels, revealing a lack of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal with Volatility rising to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands highlight Consolidation and Neutral Support.

Volume Indicators signal a strategic level of participation that holds the market in a Neutral state while ‘Smart Money’ continues to move more money into the market than Sellers are moving out. Sentiment Indicators reveal distribution, but it appears that ‘Smart Money’ is combining Short term profit-taking to hold the market strategically at a Neutral level while they gauge the impact of the FOMC results. Despite this Short term event-driven Consolidation, the market remains in a Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient, positive PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with highlights of token burns, technical breakout signals, and ecosystem upgrades. Despite these positive Long term insights, they offer fact-based caution by covering the ‘Sell Wall’, heavy Sell pressure, and Short term price struggles that help continue to counter FUD/FOMO while remaining optimistic about realistic challenges.

I find event-based Consolidations irritating, but there remains an underlying excitement. In my mind there are only 2 scenarios. ‘Smart Money’ already has an expectation and will not be surprised if there is no change and the result remains Neutral; in that case, we would continue in the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Alternatively, if the results are more positive than expected, an explosive amount of Momentum will occur in the market, and we would still continue the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase except with a turbo. I highly doubt any negative impact from the FOMC results, so I see this only going 1 of 2 ways. Now we sit back and wait; I hope you got the entry you wanted!

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has made its way INSIDE the Neutral zone, still BELOW the Short and Long term Neutral major pivot points. At LOWEST, the market will touch our Long term MAJOR Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. I do not see us going any lower. At MAX, I can see us breaking into the ‘Wall of Resistance’ to test the 1st Target MAX at $0.00001330. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. And just to be nice, the 3rd Target MAX will be $0.00001460.

2025-05-05 19:49:09,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are ramping up pressure against the ‘Sell Wall’ in an attempt to revitalize ‘Price Action’ and smooth the market into the next dynamic phase cycle. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are strategically increasing pressure at a stable pace while steering the market to Neutral ground and leaving Sellers with Weak control. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which seems to highlight that the ‘Bear Trap’ phase is coming to an end and that a Bullish Consolidation cycle is active. Bollinger Bands show expansion, which is an early sign of Consolidation in conjunction with the insight of the price’s position WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and recapturing the Short term EMA levels while still attempting to reach our 200-Day EMA to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility remaining at the LOW/NEUTRAL of our norms range. Price movements are recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting the current Bullish Consolidation phase.

Volume Indicators highlight the surging participation we were looking for, which is indicative of the beginning of our ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Despite seeing Sellers with Weak control of the market, ‘Smart Money’ is now beginning to move more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators support this with signs of Strong levels of accumulation that are greater than the distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’. Also, the CCI confirms the Neutral ground I was referring to. PVT values indicate that ‘Smart Money’ has strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle and that we may be on the cusp of a major breakout soon. News articles have shifted their focus from the Short term struggles to highlight the Long term Bullish Utility narrative further, but they are tempered with reports that continue highlighting the significant Sell pressure from Weak activity and the sheer size of the ‘Sell Wall’. These cautions are fact-based and help alleviate FUD/FOMO, while still allowing us to see Strong positive signals for growth from token burns, promising technical signals, and Shibarium developments. They continue to signal Long term institutional support and awareness too.

I expect things to continue following the identified dynamics we have been able to support with technicals and fundamentals . This appears to be the last of the ‘Shake’ and the more welcoming side of Consolidation, where we begin Uptrending at a stable pace as seen by the Average True Range retaining such a LOW value. This phase, which we have observed over the past couple of days, is what I would characterize as an accumulation area where ‘Smart Money’ is able to find enough Sellers to build what I use in my own methodologies as an ‘Antifragile’ position. This is a wise move because, when you think about it, they are able to absorb the ‘Sell Wall’ while also converging a technical structure with a liquidity dynamic. Just look at the ‘Bear Trap’ that was set recently that led to the position we are at now. I would not say that it is manipulation, but it is a consistent strategic position that is also creating a cushion for the market moving forward, as their position creates a hedge against any market shocks that we could experience from external catalysts. My advice is to be patient, get ready, and follow the dynamics because the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase is about to begin soon.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW, which is acting as our current very Short term (NOW) Neutral major pivot point. Thinking about it in increasing time frames, the next Neutral major pivot point to capture would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. The market wants to return to the Long term Neutral zone, which is all the way up near the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. That is just the Neutral ground breakdown. At MAX, the market will attempt to reach its 1st Target after the Neutral zone at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. Let us focus only on the 1st Targets because that is where the market is at. The LOWEST point is our 1st and ONLY LOW Target, and it aligns with the Long term MAJOR Support at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. A fall BELOW that level would constitute a CRITICAL decline.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

200day ema to revitalize price action. volatility indicators support the bollinger bands expansion, with volatility remaining at the lowneutral of our norms range. price movements are recapturing ground within the volatility bands, supporting the current optimistic consolidation phase. volume indicators highlight the surging participation we were looking for, which is indicative of the beginning of our breakout initiation phase. despite seeing sellers with weak control of the market, smart money is now beginning to move more money into the market than sellers can move out. sentiment indicators support this with signs of strong levels of accumulation that are greater than the distribution from the sell wall. also, the cci confirms the neutral ground i was referring to. pvt values indicate that smart money has strengthened the long term positive trend cycle and that we may be on the cusp of a major breakout soon. news articles have shifted their focus from the short term struggles to highlight the long term optimistic utility narrative further, but they are tempered with reports that continue highlighting the significant sell pressure from weak activity and the sheer size of the sell wall. these cautions are factbased and help alleviate fudfear of missing out, while still allowing us to see strong positive signals for growth from token burns, promising technical signals, and shibarium developments. they continue to signal long term institutional support and awareness too. i expect things to continue following the identified dynamics we have been able to support with technicals and fundamentals . this appears to be the last of the shake and the more welcoming side of consolidation, where we begin uptrending at a stable pace as seen by the average true range retaining such a low value. this phase, which we have observed over the past couple of days, is what i would characterize as an accumulation area where smart money is able to find enough sellers to build what i use in my own methodologies as an antifragile position. this is a wise move because, when you think about it, they are able to absorb the sell wall while also converging a technical structure with a liquidity dynamic. just look at the bear trap that was set recently that led to the position we are at now. i would not say that it is manipulation, but it is a consistent strategic position that is also creating a cushion for the market moving forward, as their position creates a hedge against any market shocks that we could experience from external catalysts. my advice is to be patient, get ready, and follow the dynamics because the breakout initiation phase is about to begin soon. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is resting at the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow, which is acting as our current very short term now neutral major pivot point. thinking about it in increasing time frames, the next neutral major pivot point to capture would be the 38.2 retracement of the 13week low at 0.001300. the market wants to return to the long term neutral zone, which is all the way up near the neutral major pivot point at 0.001350. that is just the neutral ground breakdown. at max, the market will attempt to reach its 1st target after the neutral zone at the 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001380. let us focus only on the 1st targets because that is where the market is at. the lowest point is our 1st and only low target, and it aligns with the long term major support at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week low at 0.001220. a fall below that level would constitute a critical decline. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can

2025-05-04 20:02:51,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

‘Smart Money’ has Sellers hitting the floor price in a tight Consolidation phase where we have a narrow micro Support and Resistance range serving as an accumulation area and continuing to set the stage for a breakout. Momentum Indicators reveal Buyers moving with caution against the remaining ‘Sell Wall’, as it has the potential to shake out Weak conviction whales. Currently, this cautious exchange holds just ABOVE Oversold levels, with Sellers maintaining a sustained Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are in a contraction that is expanding; I won't call it an expansion, just a growing contraction phase that holds a resilient breakout signal. ADX values show elevated yet Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a lack of ‘Price Action’ in the current market. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, as Volatility has fallen deeper into the LOW end of our norms range. Volatility Bands are tightening as the price attempts to Consolidate within their Support channels, confirming a Bearish Consolidation phase.

Volume Indicators continue to show increased participation, yet in the Short term we can see a cautious pause, which may be our calm before the storm. The ‘Sell Wall’ continues to move more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ is accumulating. Sentiment Indicators reveal an institutional level of caution for the current market, where we still maintain Strong levels of distribution, though at drastically reduced levels. This Short term strength has been able to sustain the Short term negative Trend cycle but was unable to strengthen it any further, as seen by the PVT holding a Strong positive value which indicates the resiliency of the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the Utility narrative with Strong signals of utilization from Shibarium transactions and the potential catalyst from influencers, which continue to highlight our evolution while helping to counter FUD/FOMO. Coverage of widespread dumping and the heavy Sell pressure from different groups helps remind investors of the Short term challenges that remain.

It looks like not much has changed as far as a Consolidation phase running sideways, which I must admit is boring rather than alarming, personally. This cautious pause from ‘Smart Money’ is not random but still part of a well-defined structure. Though we don't see it, ‘Smart Money’ is still accumulating quietly, and we are simply waiting for an intraday breakout in the Volume Indicators. Now it's just waiting through a packed, DMV waiting room style Consolidation phase that is going to take some discipline. Just to suggest some stability: if you're scared of the breakout failing, then set a stop-loss at 1 ATR movement (or roughly $0.00000012) below the current Supports. That way you respect discipline and remove the emotional bias of your untrained eyes perceiving a Downtrend, so you gain conviction and don't get shaken out.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT a Short term market BOTTOM at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At LOWEST, our Short and Long term align to show that the true CRITICAL BOTTOM is at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. At MAX, the price is going to recapture the Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ for directional bias at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‑Week LOW at $0.00001370.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-03 20:07:09,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This is really amazing to see such a pure dynamic playing out, where currently the price is testing the remaining market and allowing ‘Smart Money’ to determine if it’s time to start the next phase. This is a beautiful ‘Bear Trap’! Momentum Indicators show the last bit of squeeze pressing into Oversold territory, where Sellers have taken Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation; yet when you look at the Bollinger Bands contracting by a value of 1, it implies that the ‘Bear Trap’ is firmly set and breakout pressure is sustaining confirmation. ADX values show stronger yet Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning the market is moving sideways with underlying stability and without ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators reveal that Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range while prices stay BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands. This confirms the Bearish Consolidation and supports the Bollinger Bands signal for building breakout pressure, as the price will look to return WITHIN those Bands of Support and Resistance.

Volume Indicators finally show a massive spike in Short term participation where Sellers pulled the market into the bottom of the wave cycle, which is part of the accumulation dynamic. This, combined with some profit-taking from ‘Smart Money’, helped support the squeeze and began moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight this strategic effort from ‘Smart Money’, combining with the last of the squeezed Sellers. Strong distribution levels, rapidly accelerating into Oversold territory, marking the height of a Short term negative Trend cycle; yet behind all the strategic participation is our Long term positive Trend cycle, which is strengthening as seen by the PVT value sharply increasing. News articles have ramped up the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting impressive technical signals, massive token burn efforts, and the new SHIB Pay. These continue to build investor confidence and counter FUD/FOMO. Their cautions offer mixed market signals by showing some Bearish technical Trends and competition from emerging coins, which helps remind us of the realistic challenges that still lie ahead.

Most will see this as a Downtrend, and it technically is. However, the way I view the charts is that this is the beginning of a new Uptrend. It strategically traps some of the late Sellers and Bears while testing the supply. This was the LOW Volume test of the ‘Shakeout’, and from here I expect the Consolidation to run its course so we can gear up to begin an Uptrend cycle that will test the Resistance boundaries.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is holding WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 2nd-level Support pivot point. The market really wanted to bounce off that 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/HIGH at $0.00001270, and it was a great position to set the ‘Bear Trap’ without needing to respect the Long term Support level at $0.00001220, which coincides with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is the LOWEST point for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price is going to start retracing, and we will follow a path based on the next 3 Targets. 1st Target MAX will be to recapture the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. 3rd Target MAX will be to reach the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.

2025-05-02 19:46:42,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We are following proper market structure and respecting the price dynamics that we have identified over the past couple of days, which point to the formation of a ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are sustaining a stable level of pressure against rising levels of profit-taking, nearly completing the full cycle needed to begin the next phase, despite holding only Weak control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure. ADX values show Average Trend strength, with the price ABOVE the Supertrend and AT the EMA levels across both Long and Short term time frames, meaning the market is attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting both the breakout and Consolidation signals.

Volume Indicators highlight Weak levels of participation, which is encouraging since it reveals fewer Sellers in the market. Buyers, in spite of their Weak control, are continuing to move more money into the market than is being moved out. Sentiment Indicators show the last bit of distribution from Sellers, but this was only enough to counter the Short term Trend and smooth it back to a Neutral Trend cycle. Overall, ‘Smart Money’ has continued to add Bullish pressure and increase the strength of the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue supporting the Utility narrative with Bullish coverage of substantial token burns, technical signals for breakouts, and utility developments like SHIB pay. These articles build the case for incoming HIGHS while also offering fact-based perspectives about the significant ‘Sell Wall’ resistance. These cautions help to counter FUD/FOMO and keep investor expectations based on realistic market challenges.

I feel like I put together a pretty compelling analysis for the potential for the rest of the month, so I do anticipate continuing to see the market dynamics unfold into the ‘Breakout Initiation’ phase. We might run sideways here and there, but overall Bullish Consolidation should pick up and soon we will start an Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistance signal that the price is resting AT the Neutral zone at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. As investors begin accumulating through this Neutral range, I do not see us going much lower than a test of the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, if we experience a stronger pullback than expected, the Target would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At MAX, the price will rise ABOVE the Neutral zone and break through the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-05-01 20:18:04,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looking at these charts feels like watching the final pieces of a puzzle fall into place. Momentum Indicators show ‘Smart Money’ increasing the pressure on Seller positions to shake out the last of the Weak conviction profit-taking. This rapid pressure across multiple time frames has led to those few remaining Sellers exercising very Weak control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is rising WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Bullish Consolidation and Uptrend cycle. Bollinger Bands are following that small incremental movement, which is a characteristic dynamic of the market that indicates Consolidation, while underlying this is a ballooning breakout pressure building. ADX values seem to have captured the very beginning of the Uptrend, moving with Average Trend strength and holding the price ABOVE the Superrend and all EMAs to confirm an active level of renewed ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding firm in the Neutral of our norms range. Prices are confirming the Uptrend cycle by elevating through the Volatility Bands and rising ABOVE the HIGH Bands. This further highlights the Bullish Consolidation phase leading into a breakout cycle.

Volume Indicators are confirming the profit-taking, as the reduced level of participation reflects the exit of those Short Sellers, while Long term participation remains stable to show ‘Smart Money’. Despite these matching levels of participation, ‘Smart Money’ is strategically moving more money into the market than Sellers are moving out.  Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong accumulation phase that ‘Smart Money’ has sustained, which has now begun entering its Neutral cycle. This emerging positive Trend cycle will add accelerated strength to the Long term positive Trend if sustained over multiple time frames. News articles have seemingly killed the MEME narrative and are specifically highlighting the Utility aspects of Shiba Inu. Articles emphasizing the size of token burns, technical signals that support incoming highs, and admiration for strategic developments like the Shibarium integration all use positive fact-based coverage to highlight the Resistances and Volumes. This Bullish Long term narrative continues to counter FUD/FOMO while reminding investors of both the potentials and the challenges ahead.

I follow my own methodologies, and based on how I see and assess market dynamics, everything is beginning to be characteristic of the expected next phase: ‘Breakout Initiation’. Usually, the breakout marks a transition where balance shifts from accumulation to a clear Uptrend. In the Short term, we will need to validate the breakout to rule out a one-off spike, but my expectation is that this follows the dynamics I know. We should continue a clear Uptrend with very Short Consolidation phases that are characteristic of accumulation, so do not be scared when you see that small pullback. I expect this to be the beginning of a Long Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is already breaking into the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to reach the next Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. This will be the accumulation area where it looks like Consolidation. At MAX, the price is going to follow Targets, and we are going to attempt to reach the 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470. Beyond that, the 2nd Target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001580. Should this be a one-off spike, the market will pull back within the existing Neutral range between $0.00001330 and $0.00001320. This level is just ABOVE the ‘Wall of Support’, so it would be acceptable to see the market return to this level; however, if the price falls BELOW it, one must assess whether an external catalyst or an internal market dynamic is at work. At LOWEST, the market will have the potential to reach down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection thursday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. looking at these charts feels like watching the final pieces of a puzzle fall into place. momentum indicators show smart money increasing the pressure on seller positions to shake out the last of the weak conviction profittaking. this rapid pressure across multiple time frames has led to those few remaining sellers exercising very weak control over the market. trend indicators reveal that the price is rising within the ichimoku cloud, confirming a optimistic consolidation and uptrend cycle. bollinger bands are following that small incremental movement, which is a characteristic dynamic of the market that indicates consolidation, while underlying this is a ballooning breakout pressure building. adx values seem to have captured the very beginning of the uptrend, moving with average trend strength and holding the price above the superrend and all emas to confirm an active level of renewed price action. volatility indicators continue to support the bollinger bands breakout signal, with volatility holding firm in the neutral of our norms range. prices are confirming the uptrend cycle by elevating through the volatility bands and rising above the high bands. this further highlights the optimistic consolidation phase leading into a breakout cycle. volume indicators are confirming the profittaking, as the reduced level of participation reflects the exit of those short sellers, while long term participation remains stable to show smart money. despite these matching levels of participation, smart money is strategically moving more money into the market than sellers are moving out. sentiment indicators highlight the strong accumulation phase that smart money has sustained, which has now begun entering its neutral cycle. this emerging positive trend cycle will add accelerated strength to the long term positive trend if sustained over multiple time frames. news articles have seemingly killed the meme narrative and are specifically highlighting the utility aspects of shiba inu. articles emphasizing the size of token burns, technical signals that support incoming highs, and admiration for strategic developments like the shibarium integration all use positive factbased coverage to highlight the resistances and volumes. this optimistic long term narrative continues to counter fudfear of missing out while reminding investors of both the potentials and the challenges ahead. i follow my own methodologies, and based on how i see and assess market dynamics, everything is beginning to be characteristic of the expected next phase breakout initiation. usually, the breakout marks a transition where balance shifts from accumulation to a clear uptrend. in the short term, we will need to validate the breakout to rule out a oneoff spike, but my expectation is that this follows the dynamics i know. we should continue a clear uptrend with very short consolidation phases that are characteristic of accumulation, so do not be scared when you see that small pullback. i expect this to be the beginning of a long uptrend cycle. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is already breaking into the wall of resistance, attempting to reach the next short term neutral major pivot point at the 38.2 retracement of the 13week low at 0.001370. this will be the accumulation area where it looks like consolidation. at max, the price is going to follow targets, and we are going to attempt to reach the 1st target at the 50 retracement of the 13week highlow at 0.001470. beyond that, the 2nd target would be the 38.2 retracement of the 13week high at 0.001580. should this be a oneoff spike, the market will pull back within the existing neutral range between 0.001330 and 0.001320. this level is just above the wall of support, so it would be acceptable to see the market return to this level however, if the price falls below it, one must assess whether an external catalyst or an internal market dynamic is at work. at lowest, the market will have the potential to reach down to the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001270. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.0,NEUTRAL
2025-04-30 19:46:36,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Looks like ‘Smart Money’ has moved through about the last of the ‘Sell Wall’ with Weak conviction Sellers exiting as the price takes one last dip. The accelerated pace of the ‘Sell Wall’ convinced ‘Smart Money’ to rapidly take those positions in response, rather than allowing Volatility to drive the price higher and become exit liquidity for hacker laundering and Weak conviction Sellers. This strategy has lured out the majority of the remaining Sellers in the Long term cycle. Momentum Indicators show Oversold conditions for the Sellers holding Weak levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that despite the Weak pullback into a Bearish Consolidation, the price is hovering AT the Ichimoku Cloud’s LOW Band while still remaining WITHIN the Cloud, confirming the Consolidation of the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands appear to be increasing in value, which would normally signal Consolidation in line with our Ichimoku Cloud reading, but I can see a bubble of breakout strength growing from this increase. ADX values continue to reveal Average Trend strength while the price is firmly BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating a lack of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal from the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility staying in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to place pressure against the LOW Volatility Bands, showing the market's attempts to break out and return to the Neutral range established by those Bands.

Volume Indicators highlight a sharp increase in participation, suggesting that ‘Smart Money’ is grabbing the market and moving more money in than Sellers can move out, even though we remain in Oversold conditions. Sentiment Indicators show that Strong strategic accumulation by ‘Smart Money’ is outpacing Sellers, who appear to have reached the MAX strength of their exit from the market as the Short term Negative Trend cycle grows Stronger and approaches what I would consider peak values. Despite some perceived victories by Sellers, the market has sustained its Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the resilient PVT value. News articles reinforce the changing narrative from MEME to Utility by focusing on technical breakout signals, token burn events, and ecosystem utility developments that further drive investor confidence and hint at incoming HIGHS. However, cautious articles also highlight declining Volume and Sell Walls; this fact-based narrative underscores the market’s obvious challenges and serves to further alleviate FUD/FOMO.

I think the market is at a pivotal moment where the last of the Weak conviction Sellers and the sheer depth of the ‘Sell Wall’ have been exposed. In this strategic moment, ‘Smart Money’ is modestly taking positions while still leaving room for retail investors to participate. We have encouraging Volume combined with breakout signals, and I see Strong Support at the bottom of the market when you consider everything that has influenced us over the past 6 months. After all of that, this is as LOW as the market is going to go. This further affirms that we are almost done with Consolidation and that the market is nearly poised for a breakout in appreciation. Be on the lookout for ‘Black Swan Fakeout Events’, where the market might run sideways in Consolidation after a pullback. This will look like a quick, volatile spike in price followed by a return to this price level. That is not the scenario I see happening, but I like to keep you aware of all possibilities. In essence, I am implying that you should keep your stop losses in place to protect your gains.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the expected stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ where we have tested our LOW Support range. At LOWEST, the market is going to try to test the full breadth of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. I will put out the 2nd Target BELOW this BOTTOM; however, due to ‘Smart Money’ moving so strategically, it is very unlikely that we will reach the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.0001220. That would, however, constitute a market TRUE BOTTOM where we would need to start assessing what is going wrong. At MAX, we are on a path to regain the Neutral zone of our Short  and Long term market, which lies between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This would constitute a 1st Target to recapture that zone, then the market will look to take the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. As a bonus, the next Target beyond that is the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.0001500.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-30 03:10:02,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good evening everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, my area received an intense storm, and it's not confirmed yet whether there was a tornado in it or not, but it was a chaotic day nonetheless. It brings me a sense of peace and back to normal getting to the analysis again.

Momentum Indicators show that ‘Smart Money’ is still holding against the ‘Sell Wall’ and have begun to smooth the rate of change in their favor, gaining a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators highlight the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure building. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This means Bearish Consolidation. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction with Volatility values falling yet staying WITHIN the Neutral of our norms range. The price's implied stability holds just BELOW the Volatility Bands, which further supports the Bollinger Bands' early signal of breakout pressure building as the price will look to reach back within those Volatility Bands acting as Support and Resistance levels. 

Volume Indicators signal increasing participation with ‘Smart Money’ now beginning to move more money into the market than is being moved out by Sellers. Sentiment Indicators reveal the strength of ‘Smart Money’ accumulation holding at Strong levels, and though we see a Short term Negative Trend cycle, they have further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles remain optimistic, highlighting token burns, technical analysis that supports price appreciation, and coverage of ecosystem achievements as they continue to cover the evolution from MEME to Utility. News offers few negative insights but did use Neutral articles that contain fact-based insights to continue helping alleviate FUD/FOMO while offering realistic caution for challenges associated with this asset class in general.

Seeing as this continues to follow a basic dynamic of a ‘Shakeout’ phase, I see that the Indicators are showing the weakness of the ‘Sell Wall’ beginning and the strength of our ‘Smart Money’ taking control of the market. We will likely continue through a Bearish Consolidation phase where I see us begin to level out and run sideways for a little bit before continuing a new positive Trend cycle of price appreciation.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This is roughly the Neutral ground for the current market where price movements would expectedly stay between the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 down to that Short term at $0.00001330. At MAX, the price will break out and continue up to the next retracement level at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. The thing is we lack ‘Price Action’ currently; I wouldn't expect us to reach the next retracement level but potentially just to break over the 2nd level pivot point and reach a stall zone where the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages converge at $0.00001410. After that, the market would assess the next direction. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and test the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ with the potential to make it into a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001320. If somehow we breach that level, we're just going to head to the next retracement lower than that at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 at LOWEST based upon the participation of ‘Smart Money’ currently.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

As I suspected, the Buyers have a tedious task shaking out the Sellers from the ‘Sell Wall’ as they continue to accumulate at a steady pace, counteracting the Sell pressure. Momentum Indicators show the Neutral ground developing as ‘Smart Money’ Buyers smooth the rate of change over multiple time frames, yet the ‘Sell Wall’ is so large that Sellers remain in a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are behaving as they did previously, moving in small incremental values that neither firmly outline a breakout nor a breakdown but support an outlook of Consolidation. ADX values signal an increasingly Bullish Trend strength holding the price NEAR the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, verifying the lingering resilience of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators provide greater clarity to the Bollinger Bands and support the Consolidation outlook, with Volatility remaining in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, further confirming Consolidation and the Downtrend pressure placed against the LOW Bands.

Volume Indicators show increased participation, meaning that the current price level is an attractive entry point for dip buying. Despite the massive size of the ‘Sell Wall’, for now the money flow is Weak, with more money moving out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’, yet ‘Smart Money’ Buyers have cut that level in half with the increased level of accumulation. This counteracting pressure has begun nurturing and building Strong Support in a newly emerging Neutral Trend cycle. Despite the counteracting pressures, we remain in a Long term positive Trend cycle, with Sellers barely making a dent in the Support built by ‘Smart Money’. News articles continue the Bullish narrative shift from MEME to Utility with coverage of token burns and Strong technical indicators that support the outlook of an incoming rally and gains. While remaining fact-based to counter FUD/FOMO, the News cautions about hacker laundering issues as part of the massive ‘Sell Wall’, reminding investors of the realistic challenges ahead.

I see this as the dynamic it is, and so we are still experiencing that ‘Shakeout’ phase as part of ‘Base Building’. The Indicators highlight some mixed signals, but overall, due to the clear negative counterbalance, we are likely to continue to experience further Downtrend pressure as we test the LOW Support channels. Most likely this will lead to Consolidation, as we have such Strong Support built through these LOW price levels due to ‘Smart Money’ accumulation.

Long term Support and Resistances show the price testing the ‘Wall of Support’, resting just ABOVE the 1st Target LOWEST Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, we will seek the 2nd Target LOWEST at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. Breaking this level establishes the 3rd Target LOWEST at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220, which becomes a more CRITICAL BOTTOM price level for the market to approach. 1st Target MAX will be to reclaim the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001390. This price point also aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. 2nd Target MAX rests at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001500.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-27 20:03:47,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

This ‘Base Building’ phase is becoming quite interesting, as ‘Smart Money’ only needed to sit on the sidelines in a wait-and-see phase to shake out the Weak Longs and Short Sellers. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are holding on the sidelines, grabbing positions from Sellers at a LOW but stable rate, while the market shakes out Weak conviction and presses Short Sellers through the ‘Sell Wall’. This Bearish Consolidation has reached Oversold yet only gives Sellers an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation. However, when you look at the Bollinger Bands, they give an early signal of breakout pressure building as the Bands are contracting sharply. ADX values show Strong Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while still remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. This supports the Bearish Consolidation and reveals resilient underlying ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the early breakout signal from the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices falling BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands highlight the outlook of Bearish Consolidation following a pullback, and in this dynamic the price will seek to return to this range, which further supports the early signal of breakout pressure building.

Volume Indicators also support this outlook as Short term participation is increasing rapidly, meaning that ‘Smart Money’ is grabbing these positions in the Downtrend at a stable rate. Yet there is quite a bit of ground to work through, as Sellers have moved the market into an Oversold position with more money flowing out than in. Sentiment Indicators are predictably showing the Strong distribution from the ‘Sell Wall’ and the strength of the Short term negative Trend cycle. However, when you look at the PVT value retaining that Strong Bullish positive Trend cycle, it implies that this is a temporary pullback. News articles continue the narrative outlining the change from MEME to Utility by covering large token burn events and technical signals that support incoming HIGHS and explosive gains. New keeps a fact-based narrative that helps counter FUD/FOMO by highlighting the obvious large ‘Sell Wall’.

The thing is, the market seems to be in a strategic position following measurable dynamics. I would expect some Short term weakness through this Bearish Consolidation phase while ‘Smart Money’ continues to accumulate and shake out the Weak Longs from the ‘Sell Wall’. This could be a tedious process, but that will only ensure greater stability for the recovery Uptrend to come. This dynamic step is called the ‘Test and Shakeout’ phase. I'm happy that the next dynamic phase is the true breakout phase, so keep an eye on Volume surges and prices that begin closing ABOVE some of our Resistances, which will signal the end of the next phase of accumulation. But what's really nice is the ‘Markup’ phase that follows; I'll leave that to your imagination until we get there, as I will explain it in more detail then.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are holding WITHIN the Neutral zone at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which is acting as our Short term Neutral major pivot point. Our market is getting ready to move into ‘Target’ dynamics and Strong ‘Price Action’, so I will break this down by 1st Target and 2nd Target, MAX and LOWEST. 1st Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. 2nd Target MAX will be the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. 1st Target LOWEST will be the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. 2nd Target LOWEST, also constituting the current market BOTTOM, is at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection sunday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. this base building phase is becoming quite interesting, as smart money only needed to sit on the sidelines in a waitandsee phase to shake out the weak longs and short sellers. momentum indicators show that buyers are holding on the sidelines, grabbing positions from sellers at a low but stable rate, while the market shakes out weak conviction and presses short sellers through the sell wall. this pessimistic consolidation has reached oversold yet only gives sellers an average level of control over multiple time frames. trend indicators reveal that the price is below the ichimoku cloud, which confirms the pessimistic consolidation. however, when you look at the bollinger bands, they give an early signal of breakout pressure building as the bands are contracting sharply. adx values show strong trend strength with the price below the supertrend and short term emas while still remaining above the 200day ema. this supports the pessimistic consolidation and reveals resilient underlying price action. volatility indicators support the early breakout signal from the bollinger bands, with volatility falling to the neutral of our norms range. prices falling below the low volatility bands highlight the outlook of pessimistic consolidation following a pullback, and in this dynamic the price will seek to return to this range, which further supports the early signal of breakout pressure building. volume indicators also support this outlook as short term participation is increasing rapidly, meaning that smart money is grabbing these positions in the downtrend at a stable rate. yet there is quite a bit of ground to work through, as sellers have moved the market into an oversold position with more money flowing out than in. sentiment indicators are predictably showing the strong distribution from the sell wall and the strength of the short term negative trend cycle. however, when you look at the pvt value retaining that strong optimistic positive trend cycle, it implies that this is a temporary pullback. news articles continue the narrative outlining the change from meme to utility by covering large token burn events and technical signals that support incoming highs and explosive gains. new keeps a factbased narrative that helps counter fudfear of missing out by highlighting the obvious large sell wall. the thing is, the market seems to be in a strategic position following measurable dynamics. i would expect some short term weakness through this pessimistic consolidation phase while smart money continues to accumulate and shake out the weak longs from the sell wall. this could be a tedious process, but that will only ensure greater stability for the recovery uptrend to come. this dynamic step is called the test and shakeout phase. i am happy that the next dynamic phase is the true breakout phase, so keep an eye on volume surges and prices that begin closing above some of our resistances, which will signal the end of the next phase of accumulation. but what is really nice is the markup phase that follows ill leave that to your imagination until we get there, as i will explain it in more detail then. long term support and resistances show that we are holding within the neutral zone at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week high, which is acting as our short term neutral major pivot point. our market is getting ready to move into target dynamics and strong price action, so i will break this down by 1st target and 2nd target, max and lowest. 1st target max will be the 50 retracement of our 13week highlow at 0.001520. 2nd target max will be the 38.2 retracement of our 13week high at 0.001640. 1st target lowest will be the 50 retracement of our 4week highlow at 0.001290. 2nd target lowest, also constituting the current market bottom, is at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week low at 0.001230. interestingly, this market bottom is not the true critical level mathematically, but hitting it would still be significant. do not worry, though, because what it would take to move to critical levels is like a major global catastrophe, a type of event that shakes out the whales with nerves of steel. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they are the most important to you in the world. the petition still needs your help. make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. together, we can make great changes, and through shiba inu, we can harness the collective power of this community. petition",0.8954790392890573,POSITIVE
2025-04-26 16:04:17,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are continuing to grab everything that the ‘Sell Wall’ lets go of through the dips, and are sustaining an Uptrend cycle. Momentum Indicators show that as the price appreciates further, the rate at which Sellers continue to offload (just as we approach their price level) is creating an opportunity for ‘Smart Money’ Buyers to take these positions and smooth the rate of change to a Neutral level while exerting and taking even greater control of the market in the Short term. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, placing pressure against the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, highlighting a Bullish Consolidation phase with building breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and our Long term EMAs, while showing the 12-Day EMA to be a level of Support/Resistance. This continues to highlight active ‘Price Action’, though. Volatility Indicators support the Bullish Consolidation of the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements continue to hold WITHIN the Volatility Bands while placing pressure against the HIGH Bands to support an outlook of Uptrend continuation and Bullish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators show reduced participation from investors, yet that pullback is beginning to slow down. Despite the ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, the ‘Sell Wall’ has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong levels of distribution from Sellers, leading to Neutral Short term pressure, yet ‘Smart Money’ accumulation was enough to further strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle and cultivate an Uptrend breakout. News articles are shifting focus with an even more Bullish narrative for Shiba Inu, using headlines that forecast explosive moves supported by technical indicators and ecosystem upgrades such as the Shibarium dApp store. News shows some of the hurdles from the resistance barriers and shifting leadership signals, inviting a balanced perspective that continues to help mitigate FUD/FOMO while still acknowledging SHIB's Utility potential.

In the way I'm looking at these Indicators, it appears as if we're starting to see Momentum and Volume begin to falter due to a lack of Buy support. In the Short term, we'll see Sell pressure dominate the Volume, which will lead to a Consolidation phase or a minor pullback toward Support prices. This will pick up Buyers in the dips, leading to a renewal of the breakout Uptrend. This is an actual industry dynamic, which is referred to as an ‘Accumulation Phase’. I like to call it a ‘Base Building Phase’ because of how I see things in my mind; but unlike Bullish Consolidation, the ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in during pullbacks, and our dips aren't being viewed as weakness but rather as attractive entry points that reinforce the underlying Uptrend over the Long term. Some of my favorite investors and analysts use a Wyckoff framework, and this behavior of the market fits that dynamic perfectly.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting at a Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. We have confirmed the market's preference for retracement levels. At MAX, the market will attempt to capture the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520 as the 1st target. To extend that, in the event of a continued breakout, the 2nd target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. At LOWEST, following the retracements, the price will pull back to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. To continue on, a 2nd target breakdown would extend the LOWEST potential to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-25 19:13:57,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are plowing through the ‘Sell Wall’ and are now accumulating at an aggressive pace. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are capturing the Short term market and scooping up positions as they have increased their levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, attempting to break out, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand and highlight a Short term Bullish Consolidation of the gains. ADX values show Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are attempting to place pressure on the HIGH Volatility Bands, further supporting a Bullish Consolidation and giving an early signal for breakout continuation.

Volume Indicators highlight the ‘Sell Wall’ quite well. Despite reduced levels of participation, more money is flowing into the market than out, and the market is held at a strength just below Overbought conditions, which means that a few participants are contending with this massive ‘Sell Wall’ as if it is nothing. Sentiment Indicators reveal that the few Buyers in the market are aggressively accumulating at Strong levels, massively dwarfing the levels of distribution from the Sellers and elevating the market further into a positive Long term Trend cycle. News articles remain optimistic, with a Bullish Utility narrative covering explosive burn rates, technical breakouts, and ecosystem upgrades. The News also cautions about the massive resistance Sell barrier and covers internal development team warnings, but overall these headwinds provide a balanced counterpart that helps alleviate FUD/FOMO with a fact-driven outlook.

We have a Bullish technical setup with Strong Buy pressure and active ‘Price Action’; however, with the Volume headwinds becoming so resilient, the market may be vulnerable to shallow pullbacks. I see, for now, Sentiment and whale accumulation will continue maintaining the Uptrend cycle through short Consolidations.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360. This 4-Week retracement level shows us that the price is ABOVE a Neutral zone and is looking to continue retracing averages. At MAX, the current pressure can sustain the price up to the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. At LOWEST, the price will fall BELOW the Long term Neutral major pivot point WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-24 19:48:13,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We pulled back as expected to a Short Consolidation phase, which opened up a Buy opportunity for investors in the dip. Momentum Indicators signal that, despite some profit-taking and Buyers entering a wait-and-see phase, the dip allowed Buyers to maintain a Weak level of control in comparison to the Sellers’ participation. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a Bullish signal, and when we combine this with the contraction of the Bollinger Bands, we get an early indication of breakout pressure building following a Bullish Consolidation. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price trades ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, verifying active levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains in the Neutral of our norms range. Price stability holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, along with increasing averages, supports Bullish Consolidation and the potential for breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators reveal increased Short term participation, which means that dip Buying is occurring despite the LOW level of activity. However, overall, Sellers and profit-taking moved more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution from profit-taking Sellers, which in the Short term has overtaken the rate of accumulation from Buyers, creating a new emerging negative Trend cycle. Despite this Consolidation, the Buyers were able to sustain the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increasingly positive PVT value. News articles remain Bullish, with reports of token burns, breakout signals, and optimistic price targets that continue to strengthen the positive narrative and highlight the evolution from MEME to Utility. There are articles highlighting headwinds such as ‘Death Cross’ warnings and a major correction, but overall these narratives are geared toward continuing to mitigate FUD/FOMO through fact-based insights, which only reinforce investor confidence.

I see the market at a crossroads where, on one hand, we have some clear Bullish signals of ‘Price Action’, yet on the other hand, underperforming headwinds are developing due to Buyers losing Momentum as they gauge the market for clear direction. I think this crossroads creates an opportunity for Buy Volume to increase and revive Momentum, but we need to be aware of the Consolidation phases, as the market will likely continue running sideways until everyone gets an idea of what direction to go instead of just providing exit liquidity for a Sell Wall.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is basically aligned with the Long term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001350. Given the tightness of this range, prices could become quite volatile and move in either direction. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At LOWEST, the price is going to reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. Because this market could go in either direction, I will extend the range to a TOP breakout beyond MAX to be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. The BOTTOM, past the LOWEST breakdown, would be the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

Buyers are growing more and more Bullish and beginning to chip away at the Sell Wall, but profit-taking seems to be cooling the market as the counteracting pressure is leading to Consolidation. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are increasing their positions over multiple time frames without reaching Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, but given the attraction of the price to that HIGH Band and the continued expansion of the Bollinger Bands, this confirms a Bullish Consolidation phase. ADX values reveal Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming resilient levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising even further into the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements remain well ABOVE the Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators signal reduced participation, yet the few that are buying are counteracting a massive Sell Wall and continue to move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong levels of accumulation greater than the profit-taking distribution, which has flipped the Long term negative Trend cycle and established a positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the positive narrative by covering ecosystem milestones, burn events, and breakout signals that seem to further the shifting from MEME to Utility. At the same time, there are cautions regarding technical Resistances and ecosystem warnings that work to temper FUD/FOMO by using fact-based analysis.

We are continuing to run Bullish and Buyers are showing greater levels of control while the Sentiment remains very positive. Despite some of the Volume headwinds, if you have been following along with my process, Sentiment accounts for 49.84% of price movement and Volume only accounts for 14.33%. I anticipate that the market will run through a Consolidation phase and may pull back a little, but as we pick up new Buy Volume, this will sustain the Uptrend cycle and prevent a Strong pullback.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is in a Neutral zone, pressed between the Long and Short term Neutral major pivot points, in a range from $0.00001360 down to $0.00001290. At MAX, the price will pick up some Volume and sustain positive Sentiment, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. Breaking ABOVE this level, our next target would be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540. At LOWEST, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels and reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. If we fall BELOW this level, the depth of pullback would be the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001150.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-22 20:02:33,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I'm really glad we had this Uptrend cycle because I was excited to watch the dojis play out through the charts, and encouragingly, we have higher HIGHS and higher LOWS. We need to approach this with some caution, though, and breaking it down through the Indicators will help understand a little better what is happening and what we can expect. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers began stepping in, but the stable appreciation was consistently met with profit-taking over multiple time frames, leading to a Weak, Neutral level. Buyers hold a fair amount of control of the market, yet they are chipping away at a ‘Profit-Taking Sell Wall’. Trend Indicators showed that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which outlines our Bullish Uptrend, yet Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, signaling Bullish Consolidation when the two are combined. ADX values signal an Average level of Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning we currently have a robust level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the Neutral end of our norms range. Sustained price movements ABOVE the Volatility Bands support an outlook of pressure building for a Consolidation of gains.

Volume Indicators highlight increased levels of participation, which have kept an even level of counteracting pressure against the profit-taking, leaving money flow at a near-Neutral level, yet more remains flowing in than out. Sentiment Indicators revealed that Buyers are continuing to accumulate at stronger levels than the distribution of profit-taking, which continues to nurture a positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet the profit-taking continues to lend further strength to the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the decline of the PVT value slipping even further today. News articles were overwhelmingly Bullish with Sentiment for Shiba Inu, with projections of drastic moves, breakout patterns, and technical indicators which are driving a narrative of a substantial rally incoming with the additional, continued shift from MEME to real world adoption and Utility. They have isolated articles with cautions, but these continue to show the ongoing effort to counter FUD/FOMO by using fact-based insights to help investors stay attentive to market dynamics.

The Trend is clearly Bullish and Buyers are gradually taking greater control of the market, but Volatility continues to remain LOW and, to me, that indicates a Consolidation phase. We continue to have breakouts from some of our Bands, which supports further gains, but Volume at Neutral means that we should expect to continue testing higher Support levels with temporary Consolidations and minor pullbacks. Any surge in Volume would help confirm the market environment for some of the more cautious investors waiting on the sidelines.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is currently testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to follow the 4-Week retracement path up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. As we are BELOW this level, I won't consider this our MAX; rather, it would be the market's attempt to capture a Short term Neutral major pivot point. I see a scenario of Consolidation where there's a defined stall range that I noticed, with the 18-Day moving average resting at $0.00001420 and the 18-Day moving average just BELOW it at $0.00001400. I would say that our MAX would be the height of that stall range, which converges with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. If we breach this level, we will confirm the 13-Week retracements and establish the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540 as the next MAX target. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. If this triggers a stronger pullback, it would fall down to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-21 19:49:34,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We entered into Consolidation as expected, but it was quite encouraging to see Buyers step into the dip, meaning they were waiting along the sidelines for entry. Momentum Indicators show that this price stabilization is contending with profit-taking as Buyers lead the market in Weak control over multiple time frames through Bullish Consolidation. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding, confirming the Consolidation. ADX values show Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Long term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 12-Day EMA. This signals Trend continuation and highlights stable ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising near the Neutral zone but still in the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are falling near the LOW of our Volatility Bands, remaining WITHIN their range and further supporting Consolidation.

Volume Indicators offer some encouragement by showing increased participation from investors entering the market through the dips and smoothing the flow of money, leaving a Neutral level with barely more continuing to move in than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation through the dips while nurturing the Short term positive Trend cycle; yet despite the dip buying, profit-taking has lent even more strength to extend the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the PVT value decline even further today. News articles remain Bullish while using technical indicators, token burns, and reversal patterns which continue to reshape the narrative from MEME to Utility. At the same time, they offer caution with signals like scam warnings, potential traps, and Bearish price predictions which work to ease FUD/FOMO by offering fact-based insights.

I can see that Buyers are edging in and the price is sitting comfortably near our Support levels while Volatility remains subdued, and all this is characteristic of Consolidation before a breakout. However, Short term Volume headwinds remain and I can see us continuing with gradual gains where the market might retrace to some of our LOW Band boundaries before establishing a solid breakout. This is an interesting moment.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This acts as our Short term Neutral major pivot point and, given that we are following such defined price dynamics, we may press a little bit lower to test the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which would be the test of the full Neutral range from Short to Long term. At LOWEST, the price will touch the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ and cross BELOW the 9-Day moving average at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. As before, if we breach this level, we would immediately go down to a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150. At MAX, the price will continue to try to reach that next 4-Week retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290, and this would be the market's attempt to establish a higher Short term Neutral major pivot point. Extending beyond this point would mean that the next test would be our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360.

2025-04-20 19:54:35,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The sustained Bullish Uptrend is stimulating Buyer activity in an attempt to get ahead of some of our Volume headwinds in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that, despite the profit-taking, there is sustained Weak Buyer control over multiple time frames, holding the market just ABOVE some Short term Neutral benchmarks. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands have contracted even further today, which signals a growing outlook for breakout potential to test higher Resistance levels. ADX values show that Trend strength is increasing, while prices are holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, signaling that ‘Price Action’ remains stable. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling even further into the LOWEST end of our norms range. Price movements continue to ride AT or ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, supporting a Bullish Consolidation outlook while also lending a Weak signal to the breakout potential that continues to build up.

Volume Indicators show Weak levels of increasing participation, which is encouraging as these investors are accumulating at greater levels than profit-taking is distributing. This further moves more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to signal increasing levels of Strong accumulation, with Buyers continuing to nurture a Short term positive Trend cycle. Despite this Buyer activity, profit-taking has given more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle, as indicated by the PVT value further declining. News articles continue with a Bullish narrative covering token burns, strategic Shibarium updates, and Bullish price forecasts that evolve the coverage from MEME to Utility asset. While there are highlights of technical barriers, high concentration risk, and some scam warnings, they all help counteract FUD/FOMO while cultivating a positive Long term outlook.

Overall, the Indicators and general Sentiment remain positive and point to a Bullish outlook. The Neutral/mixed Volume signals continue to warrant caution, and I would expect a Consolidation of the gains while we proceed through a Bullish Consolidation phase until Volume increases validate a stronger Long term Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price has breached the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and is attempting to follow the retracement path of the 4-Week levels, but it has run into a stall range as indicated by the convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic, which has reached 80%, at $0.00001250. At MAX, the price will attempt in the Short term to reach that benchmark 50% retracement level of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to around the previous 38.2% retracement level of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230 for a Short term Consolidation to test market direction. Falling BELOW this level would trigger a test of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the defined stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where our 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

2025-04-19 20:35:54,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We have a mixed landscape of pressures converging in the market, lending support to the Uptrend following a Short Consolidation as investors gauged the market. Momentum Indicators highlight these resilient pressures by showing Buyers increasing control of the market over multiple time frames, smoothing the price movements into a Bullish Consolidation range. Trend Indicators show the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold the same level of breakout potential from yesterday. ADX values are signaling increasing Trend strength through the Short term, while price movements hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This confirms that Buyers have activated stable levels of ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range. The Bullish Consolidation is well defined, with price movements placing pressure against the HIGH Volatility Bands and supporting the outlook of breakout pressure building. Volume Indicators have fallen to a Neutral level of participation, which creates a little bit of a headwind in the market. Despite the pullback and participation favoring Sellers, the counteracting Long term accumulation is grabbing those profit-taking positions and moving more money into the market than out.

Sentiment Indicators reveal that, despite the Sellers’ participation, Buyers are accumulating at a stronger rate than Sellers are distributing. This convergence of Buy and Sell pressure has led the market into a Neutral ground where the Long term negative Trend cycle has nearly been negated but is currently left at a Weak level, which is quite manageable for the market to work back through. News articles paint a Bullish picture with Strong technical signals, breakthrough price levels, and strategic developments that are steering the narrative from a MEME to one of Utility. News appears to be purposefully crafted to alleviate FUD/FOMO by grounding forecasts with factual insights, signaling a genuine shift in Sentiment.

Mixed yet encouraging signals confirm that an Uptrend is intact, yet the underlying Bearish pressures could still trigger a Short term pullback. Given these mixed signals, I see the ‘Price Action’ carrying us through Consolidation levels while the market attempts to overcome the Weak Short term Volume headwinds and break Resistance levels down to provide higher levels of Neutral Support.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230, resting WITHIN the Neutral zone ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. As before, at MAX the price will attempt to reach the next milestone retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will reach down into the ‘Wall of Support’ at a well-defined stall range where the 3‑Day, 10‑Day, and 16‑Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

2025-04-18 20:14:13,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, it's obvious that we are testing the 4‑Week retracement levels in an attempt to establish higher Neutrals ABOVE Resistance prices, but I don't see an external catalyst, meaning that this is an internal dynamic and I will assess based on clustering. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers step forward and trigger a stable rate of profit-taking as the price appreciation tests the Sell Wall. This Weak level of Buyer control over multiple time frames is already beginning to show signs of being Overbought. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are contracting again, hinting at further breakout potential. ADX values support the outlook of a Consolidation of the gains, as Strong Trend strength in the Short term holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs for a Weak active ‘Price Action’ phase. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction outlook of breakout potential, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range, while price movements are ABOVE the Volatility Bands, confirming Overbought conditions.

Volume Indicators signal Weak levels of participation despite the Strong price movements, while profit-taking contends with Buyers entering the market, moving more money in than out at a positive but near‑Neutral flow rate. Sentiment Indicators are showing Strong accumulation with a newly emerging positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet it is a Long term caution to note that profit-taking at current levels is still enough to have strengthened the Long term negative Trend cycle that the market has yet to fully claw back through and contend with. News articles show stable Long term optimism, with the Bullish narrative using expert forecasts, ecosystem upgrades, initiative progress, and technical signals supporting recovery. News continues its positive influence while painting the picture of a changing recognition for Shiba Inu from MEME to Utility, while using the same Short term Volatility cautions as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

I don't want to follow the general consensus and would like to just look at this in a purely technical way, because I think that, for me, it makes more sense with the elements coming together. We see a Strong Uptrend cycle being confirmed in the Momentum and Trend Indicators, while the price trades ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, EMAs, and the Supertrend, and all of this is converging ABOVE the Bollinger, Donchian, and Keltner Bands. In literal terms of classification, I call this a Consolidation breakout, but we have Volume remaining Neutral, so I'm not sure how much further we can sustain the breakout, as Bullish continuity is especially important ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. I think we need to see Long term accumulation and an improvement in OBV, MFI, and CMF values from our current levels to cultivate a positive Trend cycle of Buying activity. Putting all this together, it shows me that most likely we will Consolidate the gains at some point and may have some Short Uptrend cycles, but without an external catalyst and higher levels of Buyer activity stepping forward to support the Uptrend, it will eventually just peter out over this weekend.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is WITHIN the ‘Wall of Resistance’ just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of our 4‑Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the retracement path up to the 50% retracement of our 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will retreat and test the ‘Wall of Support’, with the critical level resting at the 3rd‑level Support pivot point at $0.00001130.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-17 19:31:18,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Despite the increase in Buyer activity, it was not quite enough to catalyze the market for a sustained Uptrend, and the market has returned to a Consolidation phase. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buyer activity remains Neutral in the Short term, resulting in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. This behavior confirms the Consolidation phase. ADX values indicate that the price is moving with Average Trend strength, hovering just ABOVE the Supertrend and around the EMA levels, which now form a very tight Resistance range. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation, as Volatility remains at the Neutral of our norms range. The Volatility Bands reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators are showing declining participation, which suggests ongoing profit-taking. When we examine money flow, it is clear that more money is now flowing out of the market than into it after reaching Resistance levels.

Sentiment Indicators confirm a pullback with Strong distribution in the market. Despite the profit-taking, Buyers appear to have cultivated an emerging positive Trend cycle that has reduced the strength of the Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by the PVT value moving to a Neutral level. News articles offered a renewed Bullish outlook for the Medium and Long term by covering breakout levels after the Consolidation. News articles paint a Bullish narrative, highlighting expert predictions, technical signals of strategic whale accumulation, and token burns. The same cautions of Short term Volatility remain as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO, but overall the News is still changing the narrative from MEME to ‘Utility’, which is a more fundamental encouragement in comparison to just alleviating psychological pressure by using facts. 

There are some signals of Bullish recovery showing through Momentum and Short term Trend Indicators. However, with the lingering Long term Sell resistance against Uptrends with profit-taking, it is likely that the market will continue Consolidating until an external catalyst stimulates ‘Price Action’.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180 and is resting within the Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to a critical level at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001100.

2025-04-16 20:39:35,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We’re right about where we've been over the past couple of days: holding in a sideways Consolidation phase testing both the Support and Resistance ranges. Momentum Indicators show increases in profit-taking, yet only show Sellers coming out with Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase, while Bollinger Bands are doing as they did a few days ago and are increased by a value of 1. This indicates a crossroads of Bearish or Bullish Consolidation, but still continues to hint at breakout potential. ADX values indicate that the current price is moving with resilient, Strong Trend strength extending into the Long time frames, while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend but ABOVE our 12-Day EMA. Though we have some Buyer activity in our dips, we remain BELOW our Long term EMAs, revealing the lack of ‘Price Action’ in the current market. Volatility Indicators seem to support breakout potential, as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, while price movements are beginning to place pressure toward the HIGH Volatility Bands. This further seems to support breakout potential.

Volume Indicators signal a small increase in investor participation through both Short and Long term time frames, yet profit-taking has led to more money flowing out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators now reveal Strong levels of distribution, lending more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle. New articles continue to highlight technical catalysts and a Long term Bullish bias, using expert forecasts of substantial gains. Despite the Long term narrative of appreciation expectations, the Short term narrative highlights the same Volatility possibilities but uses these articles to urge the use of stop losses and ways to gauge the market through technical signals rather than emotion. Seems that even in a Consolidation phase, the News continues to play an avid role in alleviating FUD/FOMO. 

These charts show me that we're in a position to shift towards Bullish Consolidation, but as Supports and Resistances are holding so firmly, this would only serve to test those levels again before reversing to a Bearish Consolidation. I see hints of Bullish Volatility and Long term Volume accumulation hiding beneath the surface, but these are not yet at a current level that could reverse or catalyze the market. It seems that we are at a crossroads and should expect continued Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached back up to capture the Neutral zone, resting at the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001190. At MAX, we will reach back up to try to test the old faithful 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will reach down and test the ‘Wall of Support’ until popular Indicators start showing Oversold conditions and present a Buy opportunity in a dip where the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001120 would constitute a Support BOTTOM.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-15 20:19:41,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I find the interplay of our persistent Short Selling, being moderated by pockets of Buying Sentiment, to be fascinating. It is a true tug-of-war that unwittingly keeps market dynamics within healthy ranges. This is far from a dull Consolidation phase. ""My mission is to kill time, and time’s to kill me in its turn. How comfortable one is among murderers."" Momentum Indicators reveal Oversold conditions, yet the activity from Short Sellers entering the market was counterbalanced by investors Buying the dips. Sellers maintain Weak control of the market across multiple time frames because profit-taking and Short Selling are occurring in tandem. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bearish Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, giving an early signal of breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Strong Trend strength while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This price level confirms the Bearish side of Consolidation. 

Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are BELOW the Volatility Bands, signaling a potential reversal benchmark. Volume Indicators continue to show participation that is slowly increasing on a daily basis as investors grab the dips and move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to show Strong levels of accumulation, although at a reduced rate compared to the past few days. This Short term pullback has passed Oversold conditions, and the Short term Trend cycle is emerging negative. This negative Trend cycle was Strong enough to pull the market from its Long term positive position in what I would otherwise consider a Neutral position; however, based on current values, it is technically a Weak negative Trend cycle.

In a way, I appreciate the role of Short Sellers in keeping the market active. It is like rooting for the antiheroes. Their rapid participation exerts pressure on the market in both directions, allowing for a quicker response to dips that retrace to appreciation over Short intervals. This gradual depreciation does not discourage investors. Instead, it encourages dip buying by demonstrating that the market remains active without ‘Price Action’. I do not expect us to reach critical price levels of Support. In the Short term, we will continue to trade BELOW our Indicator Supports until a catalyst emerges and Buyers become more aggressive, at which point a rebound scenario would see prices closing ABOVE Indicator Resistance levels to signal the start of a recovery phase. Until that occurs, expect a continuation of the Consolidation phase.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is currently resting at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point, at $0.00001180. The critical level of Support is more clearly defined today; at LOWEST, the price could reach the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001110. Just a little extra insight: should we breach our critical level, the Oversold crash price is mathematically projected to occur when the 14-Day RSI falls to 30%, at $0.00000870. BELOW this absolute worst case, the price could collapse to $0.00000350 when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20%. At MAX, the price will need to recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point, which is now located roughly in the same position as the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, at approximately $0.00001220 to $0.00001230.

2025-04-14 20:00:30,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

There is an interesting scenario developing in the charts where the current market is testing an extended Neutral range during a Consolidation phase. Essentially, what we are seeing is that the calm before the storm remains in place. However, underneath are some intriguing market dynamics that will be covered through the various Indicator Classes. Momentum Indicators show that Neutral ground has developed. Buyers did not exit the market; instead, pressure from profit-taking increased over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Consolidation phase. An interesting observation is that the Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as they were over the past two days but are expanding at a rate of 1 value per day. This pace does not invalidate breakout potential; rather, it signals Consolidation. ADX values still show elevated Short term Trend strength. Although I classify this as a Bearish condition, it is weakening because the pressure is not Strong Sell pressure. The price has fallen BELOW the Supertrend and our Short term EMAs but remains ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, indicating a resilient yet Weak ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion since Volatility has entered the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continuing to stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands further confirm Consolidation. Volume Indicators highlight a small increase in participation over both the Short and Long term, while money flow is slowly increasing from Oversold levels. In fact, more money continues to steadily flow into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal continuing Strong accumulation. The Trend for the Short term is emerging as a very Weak positive cycle that remains near Neutral. Despite this Consolidation, a small increase was added to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to use technical analysis to highlight critical potential breakout areas and cover the rising burn rates. This increasingly Bullish Long term narrative emphasizes positive ecosystem updates and analyst projections that favor price appreciation and recovery. Despite the overwhelmingly positive coverage, these articles also present a balanced outlook by addressing Resistance levels and investor pain points as negative nuances of Volatility. Such insights help offset FUD/FOMO. 

Overall, these Indicators are encouraging. The main takeaway is that an external catalyst tends to drive inherently volatile markets. If an external event occurs that stimulates investor confidence in a broader context, the price will explode in appreciation from its current levels. This is especially notable given how stable the market has been and how resilient it has remained in the face of declines. I do not wish to put my foot in my mouth, but there has been a healthy underlying resiliency that is valuable in its own right. At some point, we will have to break out of this Consolidation phase, yet it is hard to tell when and in which direction we will move, given how long we have held sideways ‘Price Action’. The charts show a wait-and-see phase continuing into medium time frames, meaning that the market could go in either direction based on either an external catalyst or an internal catalyst such as whale movements, which could cause either a breakout or a breakdown. Earlier, a patron remarked that “Nothing” is happening, and that is a good way to put it because nothing appears to be happening on the surface while so much is occurring underneath.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is AT the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which lies WITHIN the Neutral range between the ‘Wall of Support’ and the ‘Wall of Resistance’. This further supports the Consolidation outlook. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with our first test being just below the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. The next level above this would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price is already near its LOWEST Support levels in the Long term, and this ‘Wall of Support’ is well defined. Falling WITHIN it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. If I calculate this mathematically, then the LOWEST BOTTOM price before reaching a CRITICAL level would occur where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%, at $0.00001140.

https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition","shib daily projection monday good afternoon everyone. welcome to a new day as we dive into shiba inu analysis together. there is an interesting scenario developing in the charts where the current market is testing an extended neutral range during a consolidation phase. essentially, what we are seeing is that the calm before the storm remains in place. however, underneath are some intriguing market dynamics that will be covered through the various indicator classes. momentum indicators show that neutral ground has developed. buyers did not exit the market instead, pressure from profittaking increased over multiple time frames. trend indicators reveal that the price is within the ichimoku cloud, which confirms the consolidation phase. an interesting observation is that the bollinger bands are roughly in the same position as they were over the past two days but are expanding at a rate of 1 value per day. this pace does not invalidate breakout potential rather, it signals consolidation. adx values still show elevated short term trend strength. although i classify this as a pessimistic condition, it is weakening because the pressure is not strong sell pressure. the price has fallen below the supertrend and our short term emas but remains above the 200day ema, indicating a resilient yet weak price action. volatility indicators support the bollinger band expansion since volatility has entered the neutral of our norms range. price movements continuing to stay within the volatility bands further confirm consolidation. volume indicators highlight a small increase in participation over both the short and long term, while money flow is slowly increasing from oversold levels. in fact, more money continues to steadily flow into the market than out. sentiment indicators reveal continuing strong accumulation. the trend for the short term is emerging as a very weak positive cycle that remains near neutral. despite this consolidation, a small increase was added to the long term positive trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased pvt value. news articles continue to use technical analysis to highlight critical potential breakout areas and cover the rising burn rates. this increasingly optimistic long term narrative emphasizes positive ecosystem updates and analyst projections that favor price appreciation and recovery. despite the overwhelmingly positive coverage, these articles also present a balanced outlook by addressing resistance levels and investor pain points as negative nuances of volatility. such insights help offset fudfear of missing out. overall, these indicators are encouraging. the main takeaway is that an external catalyst tends to drive inherently volatile markets. if an external event occurs that stimulates investor confidence in a broader context, the price will explode in appreciation from its current levels. this is especially notable given how stable the market has been and how resilient it has remained in the face of declines. i do not wish to put my foot in my mouth, but there has been a healthy underlying resiliency that is valuable in its own right. at some point, we will have to break out of this consolidation phase, yet it is hard to tell when and in which direction we will move, given how long we have held sideways price action. the charts show a waitandsee phase continuing into medium time frames, meaning that the market could go in either direction based on either an external catalyst or an internal catalyst such as whale movements, which could cause either a breakout or a breakdown. earlier, a patron remarked that nothing is happening, and that is a good way to put it because nothing appears to be happening on the surface while so much is occurring underneath. long term support and resistances indicate that the price is at the long term neutral major pivot point at 0.001210, which lies within the neutral range between the wall of support and the wall of resistance. this further supports the consolidation outlook. at max, the price will attempt to follow the 4week retracement levels, with our first test being just below the wall of resistance at the 38.2 retracement of the 4week low at 0.001230. the next level above this would be the 50 retracement of the 4week highlow at 0.001290. at lowest, the price is already near its lowest support levels in the long term, and this wall of support is well defined. falling within it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. if i calculate this mathematically, then the lowest bottom price before reaching a critical level would occur where the 3day and 14day raw stochastic indicators converge at 20, at 0.001140. as always, i wish you all the best of luck with your life. thank you for your continued support. remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know

2025-04-13 19:43:31,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The market held through a Consolidation phase and I will admit I was a little worried because I did not know how new investors would react. It seems that profit-taking in the Short term did not trigger a larger sell off; instead, it helped encourage some dip buying. Those who sold did so at a modest rate, leaving runners in the market and acting with the wisdom to protect their Short term capital gains. Momentum Indicators show that the Weak pull back was enough to drive the market into very Short term Oversold territory while leaving Buyers in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold steady with breakout pressure. ADX values confirm that the sharp Downtrend has already expressed its MAX strength, resulting in a Short term dip that was sufficient to bring the price BELOW the Supertrend and the 12-Day EMA. Despite this Short term pull back caused by profit-taking, the market remains ABOVE the Long term EMAs, verifying that ‘Price Action’ continues to be valid. Volatility Indicators support the ongoing outlook for breakout pressure as evidenced by the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility has declined and is holding at the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, confirming the Consolidation phase and supporting an outlook of breakout pressure. 

Volume Indicators signal a modest level of participation through the dips, which was an encouraging sign. Money flow indicates a Short term Oversold benchmark through the dip as increased money flows into the market compared to how much is leaving. Sentiment Indicators highlight Stronger levels of accumulation, while the CCI reflects the strength of the dip as a negative bump in a Longer term positive Trend cycle that is gaining strength, as seen by rising PVT values. News articles indicate that whales and retail investors are strategically accumulating while confirming the Bullish narrative with technical signals such as ‘Golden Crosses’ and Resistance prices that set the stage for a Bullish breakout if the Support holds as expected. The Long term optimism is tempered with Short term cautions regarding Volatility due to many holders experiencing losses and a declining market ranking. However, these reports also outline a path for recovery rather than doom and gloom. As usual, the News does an excellent job of alleviating FUD/FOMO.

Overall, the breakout potential has not been invalidated by the current resilient Indicator values, although they do confirm the Short term Volatility of this asset class. Given the market's resiliency and investors reaction to the pull back that led to Consolidation, the market will continue to Consolidate as a way of gauging Short term direction. It will also continue to build Buy pressure in an Uptrend cycle to test higher Resistance levels.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price remains ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. The analysis confirms that the market is following the 4-Week retracement levels and is currently resting at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. This is a healthy Neutral range while Buy pressure is building. At MAX, the price will reach up to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to test the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001180.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-12 20:13:52,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These charts are quite calm in spite of the renewed Buyer interest. The activity is not overwhelming, which implies a healthy level of stability in the current market. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buy pressure has strengthened in the Short term, reaching an Overbought benchmark. Buyers hold an Average level of control over the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that price movements are hovering near the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud while still remaining WITHIN it, which indicates Bullish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, implying that despite the market being Overbought, breakout pressure is building. The price is positioned ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, while the Short term EMAs are rising ABOVE the Long term EMAs. This suggests a Strong level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are building near the HIGH Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation that is building toward a breakout.

Volume Indicators reveal reduced investor participation in both the Short and Long term, as if indicating a calm before the storm. Despite this reduced participation, current money flow shows more money moving into the market, which lends strength to the stable Uptrend during Consolidation. The market remains in a Long term Weak Bearish Neutral position, with plenty of room before conditions become truly Overbought or Oversold. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of accumulation with additional strength building toward an emerging positive Trend cycle. However, underlying profit-taking forces the market to persist through a Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by declining PVT values. News articles offer a Long term Bullish bias with narratives based on technical analysis that confirm Support and Resistance levels as predictors of price appreciation. Additional positive insights regarding ecosystem developments and updates from developers further illustrate the utilization narrative. Although Short term cautions about Volatility persist, the articles continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

Due to the inherent stability observed in the Indicators and the growing positive bias among institutional investors, the Short term price dynamic would be to continue a Bullish Consolidation while building to a point that may trigger a Volatile breakout. Some caution remains, but overall the Indicators and general Sentiment imply continued Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are currently resting AT our Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is just ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position falls WITHIN the Neutral range ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, confirming Bullish Consolidation. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement path and test the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290 as a way to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’. If investor confidence increases, the breakout would extend further, reaching the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. This would extend the range from the very Short term into the Mid term. At LOWEST, the price will pull back and then bounce off the ‘Wall of Support’. The mathematically critical price level is at $0.00001140, where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-11 19:56:21,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

As positive Buy energy picks up, the market environment demonstrates the stability needed to nurture Long term recovery within a tight trading range that appears as Consolidations through Short spans. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are contending with Sell pressure in the form of profit-taking, which leads to a Weak Bullish rate of change over multiple time frames. Buyers currently hold Average levels of control over the market with plenty of room before reaching Overbought conditions.Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract again, implying a building breakout potential for the market. ADX values confirm Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, highlighting active ‘Price Action’ throughout the current market. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands show that price movements are near the HIGH Bands and are attempting to break ABOVE, which supports an outlook of appreciation.

Volume Indicators clarify the Buyers' struggle against Seller outflows resulting from profit-taking by revealing reduced levels of Short and Long term participation. Although there is stable Sell pressure from profit-taking, more money has begun flowing into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators highlight the continued strengthening of the emerging positive Trend cycle with Strong levels of accumulation that have weakened the PVT value and nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle. This can be considered roughly a Neutral ground. News articles offered a renewed Bullish, Long term narrative for the ecosystem by highlighting the anticipation of upcoming upgrades. This positive narrative shift implies that institutional recognition of Shiba Inu is evolving from a mere MEME to a broader ecosystem of utility. Articles highlight the same Short term Volatility struggles using technical analysis, yet overall they continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO. 

I am reminded of the ‘Group A/Group B’ analogy that I have referred to in the past, as incoming investors are not as accustomed to the current price levels and market behavior. It is with this underlying potential Volatility that I expect the market to continue its Bullish Trend in order to test higher resistance prices before undergoing a minor Consolidation of gains. The breakout potential is building, but even more importantly, there is a broader need for stability and recovery. I implore whale investors to take it lightly on incoming Buyers because their psychology will require stability; otherwise, you risk triggering the emotional side of that ‘Group B’, which can result in an immediate Strong pullback from which their conservative/safe investors may never return.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, which serves as the Short term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will follow this retracement path to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’, beginning at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001140. Falling to the ‘Wall of Support’ would not be significant, but falling BELOW the entire ‘Wall of Support’, specifically BELOW the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001060, would classify as a critical point.

2025-04-10 19:55:41,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that we Consolidated just as expected within a healthy Neutral range as the market continues to pick up Buy pressure in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are emerging and exerting strength, leading to a Neutral ground with Buyers establishing control of the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE our Supertrend and AT our Short term EMAs, all while attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the expansion of the Bollinger Bands with rising Volatility toward the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, which supports the extended Consolidation phase. Volume Indicators highlight decreased participation, signaling a wait-and-see phase among investors as they gauge the market's next direction. Money flow has turned Neutral with plenty of room in either direction, depending on what investors decide in the Short term.

Sentiment Indicators signal a reversal in the market as a new emerging positive Trend cycle demonstrates Strong levels of accumulation. This renewed level of participation has nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle, but there is still some ground to recover. News articles offer renewed Bullish bias for Long term potential, featuring reports on resilient technical Support levels, ecosystem milestones and upgrades, and whale accumulation. Despite the renewed Bullish narrative, the articles still address Short term struggles such as a HIGH percentage of holders experiencing losses, reduced token burn rates, and a test of the 13-Month LOW. These reports address the realistic Short term Volatility struggles of this asset class while also encouraging investors and continuing to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

From what I can tell, the market in a broader context is attempting to stabilize. Typically, we would expect the dynamic to follow a narrow trading range in the Short term as investors build confidence and comfort while deciding what direction to take the market next. Underlying this are some Bullish impulses, but otherwise the market will likely look to establish some Neutral ground.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is resting just ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001150. At MAX, we will follow the 4-Week retracements and test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will slip down and test the ‘Wall of Support’ near the midway level at the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001090.

2025-04-09 19:59:54,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our expectation was for an external catalyst to invigorate the market, and that is exactly what we witnessed. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers stepped in during the very Short term, leading to a Bullish rate of change that contested Seller control across multiple time frames and resulted in only Weak Seller dominance. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, bouncing off the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands expand to signal an upcoming phase of Consolidation. The ADX values show Strong Trend strength, with the price positioned ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating that the current market is active with ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility approaches the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands provide a breakout signal, which aligns with a Bullish Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators continue to signal active market participation throughout these phases, with a neutralized Short term money flow while opening substantial room for price movements before reaching Overbought levels.

Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of distribution, although these are considerably weaker compared to our previous averages. Despite aggressive investors returning to the market, the emerging positive Trend cycle is weak when compared to the strength in the Long term negative Trend cycle as shown by PVT values. News articles have been increasingly active in presenting a realistic view of the market by emphasizing whale participation and token burns as the main narrative. With such a realistic perspective on Shiba Inu price movements, the Long term narrative remains Bullish while still cautioning against Short term Volatility. This realistic view serves to alleviate FUD/FOMO among investors.

We are following expected market dynamics based on measurable technical indicators, but there is an external factor we must contend with. These latest price movements show that despite our best efforts, the market is controlled by players much larger than ourselves. I believe that a phase of wait-and-see will lead to a Consolidation of gains in the Short term before Buy pressure intensifies enough to test Resistance prices and establish higher Neutral zones.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the ’Wall of Resistance’, currently resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will retreat back to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001100.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-08 19:32:14,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Resiliency continues with signs of dip buying from aggressive whale investors, which is helping to hold the market at what appears to be a Short term Neutral ground. Momentum Indicators confirm that the price is in Neutral territory, with dip buying smoothing the rate of change across multiple time frames and weakening the outright control of Sellers in the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract and reveal early signs of breakout potential. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price hovers near the Supertrend but remains BELOW all EMAs. Volatility Indicators reveal an increase in Volatility, supporting the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility Bands confirm that the price is in Oversold territory, which further supports the potential for a breakout. Volume Indicators continue to signal market participation from Buyers in the dips over both the Short and Long term, leading to a neutralized Short term flow, although more money continues to flow out of the market than in over the Long term. 

Sentiment Indicators suggest that this may have been the bottom of capitulation, with Strong distribution approaching some of the highest values seen in a while. Despite the extreme Sell pressure throughout the market, the weight of Seller control only added slight strength to the very Short term negative Trend cycle, while aggressive whale participation during the dips helped to weaken the Long term negative Trend cycle. News articles have begun to cover the Long term Bullish potential of the market by highlighting technical breakouts, on-chain metrics, and burn rates as signs of positive developments, recovery, and expected price surges. Despite the increase in positive narratives, there remain cautions about Short term Volatility stemming from the significant market pain investors are experiencing during this period of panic. These articles are highly accurate and do well to alleviate FUD/FOMO for investors entering the market.

All of these signals combine to paint a picture of a prevailing Bearish Trend running sideways through Consolidation, as the market attempts to find stable footing, gather positive Sentiment, and increase participation while waiting for an external catalyst. It is this resiliency that leads me to expect the Consolidation phase to continue while the market tests Support and Resistance benchmarks.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in the Neutral zone just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001140, which is positioned ABOVE the ‘Wall of Support’. At LOWEST, the price will test the critical psychological Support level at $0.00001000. Falling BELOW this price would mean that the market could mathematically reach a BOTTOM where the 14-Day RSI is at 20%, near $0.00000690. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with the first test being the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-07 20:53:17,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that nearly every sector I analyze is experiencing an equal share of Downtrend pressure today. Shiba Inu fared well, as we are roughly in the same position as yesterday. Momentum Indicators show capitulation; however, aggressive dip buying helped smooth the negative rate of change, giving Sellers only Average control across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands expanded sharply, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price remains AT or BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet it still lags behind longer averages, highlighting continued Short term struggles. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility appears to be reversing toward the HIGH end of the norms range, while price movements stabilize WITHIN the Volatility Bands to reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators were showing surprising signs of market participation from our aggressive whale investors, who continued their dip buying at an impressive pace despite rising outflows from deep Oversold territory as more money moved out of the market than in. 

Sentiment Indicators reveal some influence from these aggressive investors while also showing that Strong distribution levels remain, although sharply decreased from previous averages. This suggests that the aggressive dip buyers have prevented the market from reaching the LOWEST prices factored by my algorithm. Despite active market participation, the capitulation led to the reinforcement and establishment of a negative Trend cycle in both the Short and Long term. News followed the Trend of capitulation and began focusing on the Short term struggles of the market. Overall, the coverage carried a Bearish tone that cannot be ignored; it would be inappropriate to dissuade investors from acknowledging the challenging conditions they are now experiencing. While there are positive projections and highlights regarding burns and ecosystem upgrades, the narrative remains negative yet realistic, tempering FUD/FOMO while outlining the current market state for incoming investors.

Combining all these insights, it seems that resiliency remains in the Long term prospects for gains, not only for Shiba Inu but across many sectors. This capitulation is being felt as a shared experience that is acting like an external catalyst. Should such catalysts turn positive or even Neutral, the turnaround and potential for gains will grow stronger relative to the depth of price depreciation. In the Short term, diligence regarding your portfolio remains in your own hands. I expect a phase of wait-and-see Consolidation as everyone attempts to determine what the f*** just happened, assess the damage of the Downtrend, and decide whether participation falls within their risk tolerances. It is truly the calm before the storm.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in a stall range that is becoming familiar, marked by the crossover of the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages at $0.00001140 WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’. At LOWEST, we will retest the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001030. $0.00001000 acts as a major psychological Support level. Falling BELOW this level would be BOTTOMED when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20% at roughly $0.00000660. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow retracements of the 4-Week levels; in the Short term, the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230 will act as a Neutral major pivot point, resting just ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220, with that range serving as a Neutral stall Band.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-06 20:29:52,Reddit,shiba,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that investors rejected the breakout and chose to follow the broader Trend across markets, leading to capitulation. Investors exiting the market are applying Downtrend pressure across multiple time frames, which has resulted in a bounce into Oversold territory. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, and the anticipated Bollinger Band breakout has been invalidated as new Consolidation phases develop with expanding Bands. ADX values reveal a Strong Trend strength is pushing the market BELOW the Supertrend level and all EMAs. Volatility Indicators signal declining Volatility, approaching the LOWEST end of our norms range. Volatility Bands indicate that the price is falling into deep Oversold territory, far BELOW the LOW Bands. Volume Indicators signal that despite the Downtrending market, aggressive Long term investors are still entering and accumulating positions; however, these are overshadowed by outflows in Oversold territory as more money flows out of the market than in. 

Sentiment Indicators continue to reveal Strong distribution levels, as the Short term Downtrend has led to an emerging negative Trend cycle that has strengthened further today. The resiliency is a silver lining in all of this, as aggressive Long term investors have maintained a consistent level of participation that helped protect the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by rising PVT values. News articles provided significantly less coverage today, but a few prominent agencies that did comment reminded investors of current conditions by highlighting machine learning forecasts that projected Long term gains and by noting that Long term holders now control the majority of the volume. This narrative of sturdy foundational conviction supports Long term gains. The articles are realistic in addressing the large number of holders who are underwater and cover the broader struggle as Short term Volatility, while also hinting at Buy potential at these LOW prices. Overall, the Bullish Long term coverage remains realistic and helps deter FUD/FOMO.

Indicators align for me, painting a picture that is emerging across many sectors where investors are undergoing a dynamic stage of capitulation. There is a general capitulation combined with Short Sellers not attracting their desired positions due to the lack of market participation, although the underlying resiliency remains. I cannot say that things are absolutely terrible, but in the Short term there is continued struggle and Volatility. I see trading confined to a narrow price range sprinkled with Bearish Consolidations while Support levels are continually tested until an external catalyst renews investor confidence. I know a whale or two is reading this, and I tip my hat to you if you are aggressive because I know! You're the winner, prosit!

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price has fallen BELOW the ‘Wall of Support’ and is now resting in a stall range, where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001140. At LOWEST, the price has the potential in the Short term to test the 52-Week LOW, falling to around $0.00001040, where the 14-Day RSI would be roughly 30%. Considering this as the current BOTTOM, if we break that 30% level, the next critical point would be at $0.00000660, where the 14-Day RSI would drop to 20%, signifying a truly critical level for price depreciation. At MAX, the price will reach back up to the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220.

2025-05-02 03:50:22,Reddit,shib,"Outlook for the Month of May through End of June Everyone is probably aware that I am not afraid to be incorrect or to put myself out there and by request I would like to cover the potential of the next month. In the past, it is apparent to me now that I didn’t cover the breadth of potential for the market so I will lay out my thesis and make a case for multiple scenarios based on my personal methodology so maybe we can get some more accuracy in comparison to the SHIB analysis process I use to teach you all.



The 1st thing we will do is look at the chart over multiple time frames to establish some basics.



https://preview.redd.it/u00kwmhjiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=8529e22fa52b658eaa66125918d604b4124c3dc3



Here we are pulled out over the lifespan. This takes each candle as 1 day. In this view we can start to see our defined level of Support at $0.00001220. Next observation is to notice the previous phases and cycles being established within the price line. As well we can determine the chart pattern and also the candlestick patterns that developed and how the market dynamics played out.



Now we need to look at more of the current section of the Long term timeframe



https://preview.redd.it/xvhmvfwliaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=475563c11e7e11329082bdd996af7981b3fd7dd9



1. 1st main cycle with dynamics is right around March 2023 and we got Credit Suisse, USD weakness. This follows dynamics until we get into the area I have in red. 



(RED) May 2023 we got US debt ceiling, and then China turns Bearish from June - July 2023. UST curve begins flattening out August 2023. Israel/Gaza in October 2023.



1. Now we get to 2nd main cycle with dynamics and this aligns with FED moves from November 2023 through February 2024



So now we see how the external factors begin to shape the cluster and that we can verify the cycles will follow dynamics



Lets get even closer on the Long term



https://preview.redd.it/hrt42qpniaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=be3a9e94839e93dc55c823715297ef62870cdfdc



By using our previous Full cycle we can establish Fibonacci levels to understand some of what happened and what to expect as we move through different regions For starters the market experienced a full retracement cycle to 100% so that is the period where we get

\-Japan March 2024- through May 2024

\-France Election June 2024

\-Equity Rout July 2024

\-FED August 2024 through September 2024

\-China Eases a bit in October 2024

\-US Elections November 2024

\-China continues easing up through December 2024

\-US Tariffs January 2025 through April 2025



We now connect the external factors to further validate the market structure. A full retracement is an immediately bad experience…sure. BUT it implies a level of reversal where Sell pressure is at the weakest strength. Look what we now have aligning. The 100% retracement level, the long term level of Support at $0.00001220, and price movements respecting these boundaries.



Now we need to get a look at a Short timeframe to begin to see the current market structure in a more volatile (more time per candle) price line



https://preview.redd.it/dbwuylqpiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=985977f7c70ac7a98956d1084639821c0223d775



Now that we are in the 4 hour timeframe, right off the bat, I can see an Elliott wave cycle following the most immediate trend cycle following our current timeframe. After a market completes a full Elliott wave cycle we are in a new trend. Looks like we have to get closer to the current time frame

https://preview.redd.it/3y4461nwiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b812685c91b1e3b7dccfc811eac8a67107336e



Short time frames show that the current trend is experiencing higher HIGHS and higher LOWS after respecting the Long term Support zone. Let’s get closer



https://preview.redd.it/qqcx72kyiaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0380eb9d5bec019393e79295fd97a1d8f9b1a8f8

  


To start I know a new phase is a base building phase and that can be tedious so we look for the next phase and we follow the Trend to our past few days out and we see 2 distinct areas that show equilibrium between the top wick off the candle and the bottom wick. This is interesting because the length of this matching pressure doesn’t fit what looked like what would be a double top. This implies ‘Smart Money’ and there are specific dynamics for that.



Is this price line going up? Down? Sideways?



It starts up, then comes down and then we get accumulation while running sideways and the price takes a smooth turn down rather then sharp. Next we get a quick ramp in Buyers which is shown on the candle as a bottom wick growing from the candle. This happened and then a sharp downturn. That’s a shake off, there is accumulation and consolidation and now a new trend starts to develop.



Now we have an idea that we are declining, there is accumulation and consolidation… this is a Shakeout phase and we now know where we are in this new cycle. Let’s go hit the indicators to support our positioning. For this kind of validation we need Volume support to show an increase in participation.



https://preview.redd.it/ax3tcjt0jaye1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=3959f259e3dfbdb588d3a93f08e1f0ef0ceaa2e5



Over a Long term view we have confirmation of the New phase and also the Shakeout phase all the way through to the new Breakout Initiation Phase. AND that means just like it sounds. Where? Near the 100% Fibonacci…reversal…remember. Also, we validate Long term Support levels and this allows us to move on to our on DD for intrinsic value based on the ecosystem and yada yada whatever you’re in it for basically and to see your margin of safety level.



A Breakout Initiation is followed by a Markup (Uptrend) phase. Again it is what it sounds like. Now we know we got to setup some tools to get a standard idea of the future.



https://preview.redd.it/80y52ds2jaye1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=e26408329c2310b1d3e770b20c290f8061ef1bc2



Here we apply our Trend lines and micro Fibonacci where we see a convergence of expected Resistance lying at the $0.00002330 to $0.00002090.



My estimate for this is to use ATR to determine the extreme move for the current Breakout Initiation phase



$0.00000091 x 3 = $0.00000273 that constitutes an extreme move potential



$0.00001360 + $0.00000273 = $0.00001633. 1st Support Target



Then transition to Markup phase gets another ATR extreme move = $0.00001906 2nd Support Target



Markup Phase gets another extreme ATR move = $0.00002179 3rd Target Support



We now have justified a price range from $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 from Now until the END OF JUNE.



Lowest Potential is to reach back down to the Long Term Support level at $0.00001220.



This is tedious to make into a tutorial/thesis style analysis but I am glad that it was requested because this was fun either way.



Hope this helps you all begin to see the current potential through my eyes and how I apply my other methodologies in a very generalized way to show you all a price projection! ENJOY!

What it is: Sending tokens to an unusable wallet (a ""burn address"") to permanently remove them from circulation.
Effect: Reduces supply, increasing scarcity.
Example: Projects like Shiba Inu and BNB have burned large amounts of tokens to support price.
How Pepe could do it:

Manual burns by the team or community.
Scheduled burns (e.g., weekly or tied to transaction volume).
2. Buybacks and Burns
What it is: Using profits (e.g., from ecosystem fees, merchandise, NFT sales) to buy Pepe from the market and burn it.
Effect: Increases demand while reducing supply — a double positive pressure on price.
3. Staking with Lock-up
What it is: Encourage holders to stake Pepe, locking it for a period and effectively removing it from circulation temporarily.
Effect: Reduces liquid supply, often causes price to rise if demand holds or increases.

I stumbled upon something I think could be the next big thing in the meme coin universe – $Peiro. Now, before you roll your eyes and call me a moonboy, hear me out because this one might just have the ingredients for a wild ride.  
First off, let's talk numbers:

* Holders ATH: We've just hit an all-time high in terms of the number of holders. This isn't just people throwing in a few bucks; it's a community forming. If you're not on board, you're missing the boat that's about to set sail.
* Price Hit the Bottom: The coin just tanked, and for a meme coin, that's often the best time to buy. Think about it – all those holders, and the price is at the floor? It's like buying land in Manhattan when it was just swamp.
* More Holders Than at Market Cap ATH: This is crucial. Even when the market cap was at its peak, there were fewer believers than now. That's right, we're building something substantial here with a foundation stronger than before.
* 1% Supply Still Cheap: Imagine owning 1% of a coin that's just starting to get noticed. You're not just buying a token; you're buying into a potential movement. And at this stage, it's practically a steal.

Now, onto the fun part – the $Peiro Meme Contest. That's right, they're throwing down $150 worth of $Peiro for the best shill. But here's the catch, you don't shill your own balls, they provide everything. This isn't just about shilling; it's about community engagement, creativity, and having a damn good time.

Why should you care?

* Community: The crypto space thrives on community. With $Peiro, you're not just investing in a coin; you're joining a group of like-minded individuals who believe in the potential of memes to move markets.
* Growth Potential: Low price, high holder count, and increasing interest? That's a recipe for potential growth. Remember Dogecoin? It started small too, and look where it is now.
* Fun: Let's not forget, crypto can be fun. With $Peiro, you're not just chasing gains; you're part of something that’s about laughter, memes, and maybe, just maybe, making some money along the way.

How to get involved:

1. Get Some $Peiro: Start small if you're skeptical, but get in there.
2. Join the Meme Contest: Show your creativity. Remember, you're using their provided balls, not your own.
3. Spread the Word: The more people know, the more the community grows, and the more potential for growth. But keep it real, keep it fun.

So, what are you waiting for? Whether you're in it for the memes, the community, or the potential gains, $Peiro could be your next crypto adventure. Be one of the first 1k holders, because in crypto, being early can make all the difference.  
Let's make $Peiro the talk of the crypto town!  
Disclaimer: Do your own research, only invest what you can afford to lose, yada yada. Let's just have fun and maybe get rich doing it.

If you’re a memecoin enthusiast, or just an investor looking for the next big play in crypto, Murad Mahmudov’s theory on the rise of memecoins should grab your attention.

In his bold vision presented at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, Murad made a compelling case that **memecoins** will be the best-performing crypto assets as we approach 2025:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqzwdGxTGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqzwdGxTGc)

He believes that memecoins will create millionaires and even billionaires, just as previous waves of innovation (like DeFi and NFTs) did. If you’re considering which memecoin to ride during this supercycle, **HegeCoin ($HEGE)** stands out as a prime candidate.

https://preview.redd.it/8djlqmsm98vd1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8304bb3a1eec7df0c72c8eff332776ec6aacf965

# Memecoins: More Than Just a Joke

Memecoins may seem frivolous on the surface, but Murad has reframed them as **“tokenized communities”** with deep cultural significance. Success in the crypto world is often about building strong communities around an idea.

Just like Bitcoin and Ethereum succeeded because they were able to gather large, loyal user bases, memecoins will thrive because they represent a shared belief or humor that resonates with a broad audience.

**$HEGE**, built on the **Solana network**, embodies this principle with its **Hege culture**, a growing community that’s already shown dedication during its early growth stages.

https://preview.redd.it/bhyfb8yl88vd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53f746e11a24e070dda27912885ed45c794c84b2

# How $HEGE Aligns with Murad’s “Post-Software” Thesis

Murad made the argument that software and tech aren’t the core product of crypto anymore – **the real product is the token and its community**. Memecoins have mastered this by focusing on their cultural value rather than the technology.

**$HEGE** is the perfect example of this “post-software” phenomenon. It doesn’t claim to have complex DeFi mechanics or a revolutionary platform – instead, it rallies around a **strong community narrative and meme culture**, which is exactly what Murad sees as the future of crypto.

https://preview.redd.it/ygvt5sfu88vd1.jpg?width=3713&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=240c1672894b8a30e37edfd1c56a2c6b74831034

# Why $HEGE Fits the 2025 Memecoin Supercycle

Murad predicts that memecoins will dominate the next cycle for a few reasons:

1. **Massive Mimetic Premium** – Just like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE rose to prominence purely due to their cultural appeal, **$HEGE** is set to capture a similar wave as memecoin fever reignites. The $HEGE character is designed in a way to have widespread mainstream appeal.
2. **Power of Community** – $HEGE has been building its cult-like community over the past 6 months, which Murad notes is a key factor in sustaining long-term value. These strong “diamond hands” holders are critical for supply constraints, driving the price up as new investors flood in.
3. **Solana as the Memecoin Casino** – Murad highlights that ecosystems like **Ethereum and Solana** have become the “casinos” of the crypto world. **$HEGE** being on **Solana** positions it perfectly for this environment, tapping into Solana’s **high-speed, low-cost transactions**, allowing memecoin traders and communities to flourish.

# $HEGE’s “Cult” Status is Just Beginning

Murad mentioned that successful memecoins build strong communities that identify closely with the token. In 2024, **$HEGE celebrated its 6-month anniversary**, showing its resilience and ability to weather market conditions.

Its recent **NFT project Hegends** is a prime example of how $HEGE is diversifying and deepening its community engagement, echoing Murad’s point that memecoins which can build loyalty beyond just speculative gains will be the big winners of 2025

https://preview.redd.it/13ffy0mc98vd1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ff3c0a67ac4034825ab949ec4988a1f71a5304b

# Why Wait for 2025? $HEGE is Already Ahead of the Curve

Murad’s thesis of a “belief supercycle” will likely play out in the coming years, but why wait until 2025 to buy into a promising project? With **$HEGE**, you’re not just buying a memecoin – you’re buying into a thriving, culturally rich community with strong momentum. This is the type of community Murad describes as having **massive potential for demand growth**

https://preview.redd.it/uvn8onkh98vd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=94551252ba45684c8208d7ddf3aed4d63781fe15

# In Conclusion

Investors looking to **capitalize on the upcoming memecoin supercycle** should consider getting in early on **$HEGE**.

**TL;DR**: Murad Mahmudov’s theory highlights that memecoins will dominate the next crypto supercycle. **$HEGE** fits his thesis perfectly by leveraging a strong community, meme culture, and its position on the Solana network, making it a prime contender for the memecoin boom in 2025.

[**www.hegecoin.com**](http://www.hegecoin.com)","why hege is one to hold for murads memecoin supercycle introducing murads memecoin supercycle thesis if you are a memecoin enthusiast, or just an investor looking for the next big play in crypto, murad mahmudovs theory on the rise of memecoins should grab your attention. in his bold vision presented at token2049 in singapore, murad made a compelling case that memecoins will be the bestperforming crypto assets as we approach 2025 he believes that memecoins will create millionaires and even billionaires, just as previous waves of innovation like defi and nfts did. if you are considering which memecoin to ride during this supercycle, hegecoin hege stands out as a prime candidate. memecoins more than just a joke memecoins may seem frivolous on the surface, but murad has reframed them as tokenized communities with deep cultural significance. success in the crypto world is often about building strong communities around an idea. just like bitcoin and ethereum succeeded because they were able to gather large, loyal user bases, memecoins will thrive because they represent a shared belief or humor that resonates with a broad audience. hege, built on the solana network, embodies this principle with its hege culture, a growing community that is already shown dedication during its early growth stages. how hege aligns with murads postsoftware thesis murad made the argument that software and tech are not the core product of crypto anymore the real product is the token and its community. memecoins have mastered this by focusing on their cultural value rather than the technology. hege is the perfect example of this postsoftware phenomenon. it does not claim to have complex defi mechanics or a revolutionary platform instead, it rallies around a strong community narrative and meme culture, which is exactly what murad sees as the future of crypto. why hege fits the 2025 memecoin supercycle murad predicts that memecoins will dominate the next cycle for a few reasons 1. massive mimetic premium just like dogecoin, shiba inu, and pepe rose to prominence purely due to their cultural appeal, hege is set to capture a similar wave as memecoin fever reignites. the hege character is designed in a way to have widespread mainstream appeal. 2. power of community hege has been building its cultlike community over the past 6 months, which murad notes is a key factor in sustaining longterm value. these strong strong hold holders are critical for supply constraints, driving the price up as new investors flood in. 3. solana as the memecoin casino murad highlights that ecosystems like ethereum and solana have become the casinos of the crypto world. hege being on solana positions it perfectly for this environment, tapping into solanas highspeed, lowcost transactions, allowing memecoin traders and communities to flourish. heges cult status is just beginning murad mentioned that successful memecoins build strong communities that identify closely with the token. in 2024, hege celebrated its 6month anniversary, showing its resilience and ability to weather market conditions. its recent nft project hegends is a prime example of how hege is diversifying and deepening its community engagement, echoing murads point that memecoins which can build loyalty beyond just speculative gains will be the big winners of 2025 why wait for 2025? hege is already ahead of the curve murads thesis of a belief supercycle will likely play out in the coming years, but why wait until 2025 to buy into a promising project? with hege, you are not just buying a memecoin you are buying into a thriving, culturally rich community with strong momentum. this is the type of community murad describes as having massive potential for demand growth in conclusion investors looking to capitalize on the upcoming memecoin supercycle should consider getting in early on hege. its building the necessary infrastructure, community, and momentum to ride the memecoin wave to new heights. the 2025 cycle could be where hege reaches its full potential and those who recognize it early will be the ones laughing all the way to the bank tldr murad mahmudovs theory highlights that memecoins will dominate the next crypto supercycle. hege fits his thesis perfectly by leveraging a strong community, meme culture, and its position on the solana network, making it a prime contender for the memecoin boom in 2025. ca ulwsjmmpxmnrfpu6bjnk6rprkxqd5jxumpps1fxhxfy",0.9482944495975971,POSITIVE
2024-09-05 10:52:39,Reddit,dogecoin,"GLOBAL LIQUIDITY  Let’s talk big picture for a second. We’re in the middle of a market that’s showing some interesting signals. If you’ve been watching Bitcoin, you’ll know that holding onto it has been profitable for 95% of the days it’s existed. So, what does that mean for us right now? Well, it’s a reminder that sometimes, the real magic happens when you just stay in the game.  
  
Now, shift your focus. Altcoins are creeping up in dominance, and we’re heading into what could be another alt season. Historically, this is when the smaller players come out to play. You know the type—coins that aren’t in the top 10 but have that unique viral potential. In previous cycles, we’ve seen meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu absolutely crush it in moments like this. It’s not just hype—it’s timing.  
  
So, what’s different this time? Well, here’s where things get interesting. We’re sitting on the verge of something similar, but with altcoins taking more of the spotlight. If you look at the data, these smaller coins—especially the meme coins with strong narratives—tend to ride the wave when market sentiment shifts in their favor. You don’t need to dig too deep to see where that kind of potential could be lurking right now.  
  
Sure, the market can wobble here and there, but the overall trend is heading into a period where altcoins might just have their moment in the sun. And if you’ve been paying attention to the types of projects that thrive in this space, you’ll know it’s often the unexpected ones—those with strong communities, a unique angle, and a bit of meme magic.  
  
So, if you’re looking at coins sitting around the $10M to $20M market cap range, ask yourself this: What’s going to happen if the market shifts in favor of these smaller caps? Historically, those who got in before the crowd figured it out were the ones who really benefited.  
  
At the end of the day, there’s no need to overthink it. Timing and community are everything.

I've spent a good deal of time digging into a Solana project called Tsuki that launched on May 11th, 2024. It's currently sitting at a market cap of only 1.9 million, but the charts look absolutely insane, and it feels like it's been accumulating for a while.
I know this might sound crazy, but hear me out.
Many of you know Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty or DFV. He was the guy behind the GameStop frenzy in 2021, and his story is now a movie called ""Dumb Money."" After that, he completely vanished from social media for three years.
Fast forward to now, and he suddenly reappears, posting cryptic messages on X. But here's where things get interesting.
Tsuki, this Solana project, seems to have predicted Keith's return exactly one day, one hour, and one minute before it happened. They posted a picture of Keith with the caption ""as for me I like $Tsuki."" The odds of that happening are astronomical.
It doesn't stop there. There are countless other strange coincidences involving Tsuki, Keith, and their social media activity.It's like they're playing a game of chess, and we're just spectators trying to figure out the endgame.
Tsuki's website https://tsukionsol.xyz/ is full of intriguing details about NFTs, AI, and an insane roadmap. There are even potential connections to Elon Musk.
I believe there's something massive brewing here. Could this be the next GameStop? The next Dogecoin?
What do you guys think? Am I crazy, or is there something real to this?

First, I did some digging  on the origins of JJ and its popularity, it looks like its used in more than 1M cumulative channels on Twitch -> proof here [https://7tv.app/emotes?page=1&query=majj](https://7tv.app/emotes?page=1&query=majj)  
  
Attention = Money (that's also why PEPE, Dogecoin, Popcat, BOBO, etc got to 100's of millions to billions)  
  
Millions of people seen JJ on twitch alone = lots of attention (search sajj emoji, or majj emoji)  
  
I have found that JJ being its own character is at its core a 'parody' of pepe, an oversimplified version of it  
  
So it goes like this  
  
- PEPE was created and got popular on 4Chan  
- After this appeared Peepo (APU), a baby version of pepe  
- After Peepo, appeared JJ an oversimplification of PEPE/Peepo  
  
So if you think for a second,  
  
[$Pepe](https://x.com/search?q=%24Pepe&src=cashtag_click) is at 5B$ marketcap

Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deeper into the community — and I’m genuinely impressed: the dedication, the creativity, the diamond hands, the “persist forever” mindset, the relentless DCA culture.

To me, $SPX6900 feels like a blend of $BTC, $DOGE, and $GME.
- Fixed supply (930M)
- Contract renounced
- Solid distribution (>150k holders)
- Multi-chain: ETH, SOL, BASE, SUI
- Survived multiple 80%+ drawdowns
- Nearly 2 years old (not just a flavor-of-the-week token)
- The only meme coin with a mission: flip the stock market

Frens, I have no words to express my gratitude for this incredible community. Who else would do this? In just three days, we raised $7K—this is amazing!

I will provide more updates soon—this will be a huge week for OSCAR!!!

I also want to mention that our audit for $Collar is well advanced, and we should finalize and launch the mainnet this week. Our integration with Shibarium is also progressing, meaning we are close to achieving our first major goals since this CTO was launched!

All of this will be crowned with an incredible partnership with a top-tier exchange (T1) and a campaign reaching over 40 million users! Additionally, we are in discussions and exploring possibilities with many other CEXs, including another potential T1 exchange.

None of this would be possible without the strength, determination, and resilience of each and every one of you here!!! We have proven that a community-driven and fully decentralized token can truly build incredible things, help people and animals, and deliver an ecosystem that will create wealth and prosperity for our community. This will undoubtedly establish us as one of the biggest charity projects in the world.

Furthermore, we are delivering Doge Rebase—the great dream of Ryoshi—which is something no one has ever managed to build before! This token represents far more than just a token—it is a true community of builders and visionaries!

I am old enough to remember when Amazon was a penny stock bookstore back when buying things online was something new and risky. I remember when gold prices were $200/ounce and you had to buy it in person, at a store. I did not buy any Amazon because I thought bookstores were unprofitable, and I did not buy gold because my 1987 Corolla with popup lights threw an engine rod. 

[These cars were cool once, and gold was $200\/ounce.](https://preview.redd.it/iraz6je0z6he1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3548fba226768858d2b045a0c5d478210ffd62)

I remember when my friend asked me how to buy bitcoin and we went in together to buy a hundred of them for about $10 each. We sold out at $18 and patted ourselves on the back for 80% gains. We thought we were pretty smart. I also owned Nvidia in 2012 and sold it at a loss and thought that was smart.

I have watched waves build, crest, and crash, and I have seen waves build and build and build and just keep on building. I have ridden waves and timed them perfectly, I have bailed out early, held too long, and made every mistake there is and had enough success that I am someone people come to for advice. I have had about equal success with my own business launches and my investments. Added up, I sit comfortably now. Last year my high school daughter won a stock market game, beating nearly 1000 other students across the nation. She did it by asking me what to buy, and then doing whatever she wanted, because she was 14, and smarter than me.

**What Now**

Right now all my money is in Kendu. There is nothing like it, and I believe basic market forces are going to make it a 1000X from where it sits today. If the community that is building this coin keeps its foot on the gas it could easily be twice that. Memecoins are not the same as the stock and metals markets where I have most of my experience, but they are similar, and if you have a trained and experienced eye, you at least know what to look for. 

Kendu has marketers all over the world, and has dumped its founder who got greedy too soon. Most coins simply die at that point, but Kendu had already turned into a juggernaut and instead of dying, it just kept rolling, and actually gained steam. The community is stronger and bigger now than it was for its all time high, and has none of the built-in sabotage that handicapped it in the past. It is a rising wave that just keeps building and building. A tsunami on the open ocean is actually undetectable, but it builds as it travels and when it approaches the shoreline it suddenly crests upwards. This is also what happens with markets. All the forces roll together undetected until suddenly they are towering over everything. 

We know memecoins can suddenly break out and go 10X in the course of an afternoon. We know some of them go into the decabillions every few years. We also know exactly what kinds of coins do this. There are thousands of coins that don't, and only a few that do. The winning profile is well-established at this point. You need a strong community that does its own marketing every single day, you need to grow every day, and you need to have several 90% dips that shake out all the weak ones and attract the types who will hold strong. That is what DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and all the other successful coins have done, and it is exactly what all the failed coins didn't do.

Kendu is doing all of the above and it is going to pop sooner or later. Honestly I would not be surprised if it pops later this evening, but I hope it holds out a little longer. The longer it builds, the higher it will rise.","life changing tidal wave starting to build everybody here knows that if you hit the right coin you could be sitting on an enormous pile of cash so big that it permanently changes your family line. in memecoins you can go from a corporate mill slave to a private island in a matter of days if you happen to be standing in the right spot when lightning strikes. that is why were are all here. i am old enough to remember when amazon was a penny stock bookstore back when buying things online was something new and risky. i remember when gold prices were 200ounce and you had to buy it in person, at a store. i did not buy any amazon because i thought bookstores were unprofitable, and i did not buy gold because my 1987 corolla with popup lights threw an engine rod. these cars were cool once, and gold was 200ounce. i remember when my friend asked me how to buy bitcoin and we went in together to buy a hundred of them for about 10 each. we sold out at 18 and patted ourselves on the back for 80 gains. we thought we were pretty smart. i also owned nvidia in 2012 and sold it at a loss and thought that was smart. i have watched waves build, crest, and crash, and i have seen waves build and build and build and just keep on building. i have ridden waves and timed them perfectly, i have bailed out early, held too long, and made every mistake there is and had enough success that i am someone people come to for advice. i have had about equal success with my own business launches and my investments. added up, i sit comfortably now. last year my high school daughter won a stock market game, beating nearly 100 other students across the nation. she did it by asking me what to buy, and then doing whatever she wanted, because she was 14, and smarter than me. what now right now all my money is in kendu. there is nothing like it, and i believe basic market forces are going to make it a 100x from where it sits today. if the community that is building this coin keeps its foot on the gas it could easily be twice that. memecoins are not the same as the stock and metals markets where i have most of my experience, but they are similar, and if you have a trained and experienced eye, you at least know what to look for. kendu has marketers all over the world, and has decreaseed its founder who got greedy too soon. most coins simply die at that point, but kendu had already turned into a juggernaut and instead of dying, it just kept rolling, and actually gained steam. the community is stronger and bigger now than it was for its all time high, and has none of the builtin sabotage that handicapped it in the past. it is a rising wave that just keeps building and building. a tsunami on the open ocean is actually undetectable, but it builds as it travels and when it approaches the shoreline it suddenly crests upwards. this is also what happens with markets. all the forces roll together undetected until suddenly they are towering over everything. we know memecoins can suddenly break out and go 10x in the course of an afternoon. we know some of them go into the decabillions every few years. we also know exactly what kinds of coins do this. there are thousands of coins that do not, and only a few that do. the winning profile is wellestablished at this point. you need a strong community that does its own marketing every single day, you need to grow every day, and you need to have several 90 dips that shake out all the weak ones and attract the types who will hold strong. that is what doge, shib, pepe, and all the other successful coins have done, and it is exactly what all the failed coins did not do. kendu is doing all of the above and it is going to pop sooner or later. honestly i would not be surprised if it pops later this evening, but i hope it holds out a little longer. the longer it builds, the higher it will rise.",0.0,NEUTRAL

I got to about 25$ and saw the dollar value change dramatically through the days and thought what tf is going on. Ok it's time to pull out my cash, how? They tell me to download Coin Base, ok that's alot of verification, weird? I completed the process and found my self in a completely different world, Doge, Pepe, wtf is this. I figure out how transferring works and now I have 25$ in Bitcoin, watching my balance slightly fluctuate for a couple of days I did ridiculous amounts of research. I decided Bitcoin wasn't going to get me any where with 25$ so I transfer to Pepe and Doge thinking I'd be easy to multiple what I had, no, still overall stagnant for a couple days. XRP goes up like 100% and I get in with my 25$ at 1.30$ in a couple days and turned into a XRP fan boy, it went up to 1.75$ and pulled about 180$ from the bank into XRP a day later it jumped to 2.30$, I held on to 2.90$ thinking it was going to ATH easily. It dropped to 2.40$ and I thought it's fine it'll be there soon. A couple or so weeks of waiting 60 Minutes dropped there episode on crypto, watching it go up from the past couple days it crashed extremely fast. My average entry was about 1.70$ I thought O yea I'm safe, I then realized if I sell I can get in at a better price, so I pull out all my XRP 203$. Here is my list of transactions all being my full account balance. Sold at 2.07$, buy at 2.18$, sell at 2.13$ and finally buy at 2.19$. I then make my self stop looking at the chart, I held and luckily it stayed at around 2.30$ after a couple of days. I got to experience both side of the bull run , up and down, some schizophrenia, more experience, and 20$ out of my account. I held for another week while looking more in to crypto and eventually meme coins, I think it's easy mony so I download Coin Base wallet and start buying a few random thing. I come along Hege and love the community so I put in 20$ at about .05$ thinking this was going to be great, I watched it go down but the community was stellar so I held. I go deeper by downloading Phantom Wallet and get rug pulled a few times overall losing money. Eventually I get Bull X Neo and do some paper trading and hit it on the head 3 times, I thought I was a God. I sart trading and getting rug pulled multiple times, I continued and lost about 50$. In that time I started finding out about bundle buys and wallet tracking, I felt like I was in the matrix finding out there's people with hundreds of thousands of dollars manipulating charts and completely fabricating some, I became scared and lost. I new it was gambling to a sense but didn't now how deep the rabbit hole went. Felling defeated I took a break for a few days to catch up on lost sleep. In that time I find out Trump made a coin and thought I missed out on generational wealth, I would maniacally laugh then lay on the cold floor, I later find out the earliest prices you could reasonably get in was like 3$ or 7$ or something so I felt better.

 Ok ok anyway I now have around 95% of my crypto money in $Hege and the other 5% in incase a God event happens. So given my past 4 months of crypto experience here's a list of things I learned.

1. Community is absolutely necessary to follow through on the hard times, I couldn't hold onto XRP because I didn't like the community, I felt like they didn't work together and were all only money hungry, I had no connection and didn't feel comfortable. 

Hege excelles on community more than any other, I feel extremely comfortable in the community and can see the extreme potential.

2. Dev team, these are the people who can open new doors to give a Coin more potential. The Dev team are making ads, opening new cex listings and every thing in between it feels. They clearly love the community and look to do everything in there power to ensure Hege succeeds.

3. Value, Hege's most valuable aspect is the dimond handed community and there extreme dedication to succeed, Hege is many people's conviction play and we actually injoy trying to get you guys to join because we believe deeply in Hege's success and want you to come with us and be apart of the community. Join us at r/hegecoin and find the telegraph, it's an excellent community in all aspects.

If your loosing money like I was it's likely because you betting on things with low or no value, most Coin's (like 99.5%) are traps that harness your delusions of grandeur, trust me I know.

4. Timing the market can definitely be beneficial but is a great way to miss out on great opportunities, right now hege is in the worst time to try and time an entry because we're in the consolidation stage after a great pump from a couple months ago. Remember no one knows the date or the hour of when any Coin will go up or how much, I feel confident I can assure you right now is an excellent buying opportunity and that it will go much higher than the ATH.

5. Whales beleve in the progect and have donated 400,000$ for advertising, this is the only time I've seen something like this. It's a clear indicator that they believe that this project will be worth much much more than its current value. Remember whales got alot of there money from being smart and I would assume that this was also a generous gift because they see the excellent community and Dev team.

These funds are getting deployed shortly, it will undoubtedly help the progect immensely with advertising and new cex listings, for a complete list look at the first photo.

For the new and old investors I hope this message finds you well and in a good spot to invest.

income. i got to about 25 and saw the dollar value change dramatically through the days and thought what tf is going on. ok its time to pull out my cash, how? they tell me to download coin base, ok that is alot of verification, weird? i completed the process and found my self in a completely different world, doge, pepe, wtf is this. i figure out how transferring works and now i have 25 in bitcoin, watching my balance slightly fluctuate for a couple of days i did ridiculous amounts of research. i decided bitcoin was not going to get me any where with 25 so i transfer to pepe and doge thinking id be easy to multiple what i had, no, still overall stagnant for a couple days. xrp goes up like 100 and i get in with my 25 at 1.30 in a couple days and turned into a xrp fan boy, it went up to 1.75 and pulled about 180 from the bank into xrp a day later it jumped to 2.30, i held on to 2.90 thinking it was going to ath easily. it dropped to 2.40 and i thought its fine it will be there soon. a couple or so weeks of waiting 60 minutes dropped there episode on crypto, watching it go up from the past couple days it crashed extremely fast. my average entry was about 1.70 i thought o yea i am safe, i then realized if i sell i can get in at a better price, so i pull out all my xrp 203. here is my list of transactions all being my full account balance. sold at 2.07, buy at 2.18, sell at 2.13 and finally buy at 2.19. i then make my self stop looking at the chart, i held and luckily it stayed at around 2.30 after a couple of days. i got to experience both side of the bull run , up and down, some schizophrenia, more experience, and 20 out of my account. i held for another week while looking more in to crypto and eventually meme coins, i think its easy mony so i download coin base wallet and start buying a few random thing. i come along hege and love the community so i put in 20 at about .05 thinking this was going to be great, i watched it go down but the community was stellar so i held. i go deeper by downloading phantom wallet and get rug pulled a few times overall losing money. eventually i get bull x neo and do some pinvest large amountr trading and hit it on the head 3

2025-01-19 08:29:30,Reddit,doge,"TRUMP vs ELON - official coins and their impact TRUMP vs. ELON Coins: Will They Moon or Bust?

The crypto world is buzzing with the launch of not one, but two high-profile memecoins—$TRUMP and $ELON. While $TRUMP has gained traction due to its direct endorsement by Donald Trump himself, the launch of an ""official"" $ELON coin adds another twist to the narrative. Let's dive into the possible trajectories for these tokens and what this means for $DOGE.

# $TRUMP Predictions

* **Momentum:** $TRUMP is riding on Trump's political clout and massive following. The initial hype and astronomical trading volume (\~$1.5B in 6 hours) suggest it could continue surging short-term as traders FOMO in.
* **Sustainability:** The tokenomics (80% locked supply) will likely keep prices volatile. Once the lock-up ends, watch out for possible sell-offs by insiders.
* **Outlook:** Likely to moon for a while, but the long-term depends on whether Trump uses it as a serious part of his campaign or if it fades like other hype-driven tokens.



# $ELON Predictions

* **Concerns About Authenticity:** Unlike $TRUMP, the $ELON coin has no confirmed endorsement by Elon Musk (yet). This raises doubts about its legitimacy. Could it be a **rug pull**? Definitely worth treading carefully.
* **Potential Impact:** If Musk endorses it (even jokingly), expect a DOGE-style rally. Otherwise, it might remain speculative and fail to gain traction.
* **Outlook:** Until Elon Musk directly acknowledges the token, $ELON might struggle to establish itself beyond being another speculative memecoin.



# What Happens to $DOGE?

Elon and Trump have historically supported $DOGE as the ""people's coin."" However, the introduction of these official coins might shift attention:

1. **Short-Term Impact:** Liquidity could flow away from $DOGE to $TRUMP and $ELON as traders chase quick gains.
2. **Long-Term Impact:** If neither $TRUMP nor $ELON delivers on utility, traders might rotate back to $DOGE, which already has a strong community and broader adoption.



# Key Risks and Final Thoughts

1. **Hype-Driven Volatility:** Both coins are extremely risky, especially with limited market history.
2. **Potential Rug Pulls:** Be cautious with $ELON, as its legitimacy isn’t verified.
3. **Market Impact:** These coins could temporarily drain liquidity from other assets, leading to dips in broader markets.

If $TRUMP continues to moon, it might validate the concept of high-profile political or celebrity memecoins, paving the way for more launches. $ELON could go either way, but without Musk’s direct support, it seems far more speculative.

What do you think? Will $TRUMP and $ELON disrupt the memecoin landscape, or will this hype fizzle out?

2025-01-05 20:06:42,Reddit,doge,"detailed pumpamental analysis: CHILLGUY Before any flack comes my way, let me preface: i own over 30 alts/alphas so this thesis was written out with objectivity in mind; regardless, the closer we get to alt season, **the more it confirms the notions credibility** 

ill try to break it down as smoothly and elaborately as i possibly can.

the whole purpose of this thesis is to hunt down the next SHIB/DOGE. now again, **this isnt a sales pitch**; ***but a rather a detailed rundown of pumpamentals that place CHILLGUY as this cycles SHIB/DOGE mimicking 2021s alt cycle from where we stand rn***, which is **phase 4** of the bullrun. now is everything gonna pump during alt season? perhaps, everything moves in a bullrun - but im **hunting for the one thatll change lives** not “help stay afloat” for a few more months.

so to begin; DOGE blew up - **issa dog**.

SHIB ***then*** blew up, **also a dog**.

fast forward to present: **dogs are now memecoin staples**.

PEPE had **news** of a teen who made ***millions*** from 20 bucks, and the infringement lawsuit. thats ur headline 

thus **PEPE became a staple**.

BONK, WIF, all these animal tokens theyre fueled by the family of DOGE + SHIB + PEPE’s hype at the start of the bullmarket which stabilized their position throughout the entire cycle, thus limiting potential peak-top gains/returns from this point onwards.

now **cats**. how did they make their way into the crypto meme space? cats got so viral during 2024 ***its no surprise*** that cats made their way from the irl memeworld into the crypto space hype.

the way i see it is **memes should be viral aaass fuuuuuqqqqq** ***before*** entering altcoin season.

the only strong contender imo is CHILLGUY - and i own a lot of diff coins ***including BOME*** PEPE and KENDU.

for now tho just humor me for a second rlly, lets take a look at the pumpamentals of CHILLGUY so far:

1. blew tf up **IRL** as a meme, became culture, ***then a generational movement*** of letting go when things dont go ur way.

2. everyone their moms and their dogs know chill guy at this point, yet none of em have ever been in the market before or even heard of crypto. 

3. USA today crowned chill guy, ***the irl meme***, as top 10 memes of all 2024… **the bitch wasnt even out for two months and turned the entire years memespace!!!!**

4. landed headlines of copyright infringement (as PEPE did)

5. the meme crypto space is all about new **first time** investors. investors who ***know nothing about crypto***, never heard of “narratives” moving avg RSI values fair value gaps **nothing**.

***again*** humor me for a sec and riddle me this; do you ***rlly*** think new ***first time*** investors who know **nothing** about crypto are gonna open a trading app, see the ***entire*** selection of foreign letters numbers and colors - alongside CHILLGUY - and ignore the **one thing** that acc made sense to them? these apps are **dizzying** and the array of selection will ***force*** first time investors to flock into **what** ***they*** **recognize** ***and*** **relate to**.

these ppl have their classmates, friends everywhere posting chill guy references **without even knowing** a thing about crypto, or that CHILLGUY is also a coin. they open instagram - chill guy. open stories, chill guy. its unstoppable cuz ***its memes*** and its culture. **and it makes no fkn sense**

remember, all these ***new*** first time investors will recognize CHILLGUY, then proceed to get a bag, which pumps. that initial pump incites fomo, which then fuels a secondary pump, **just** so a new bunch of other new investors fomo in right after; thus fueling the third pump - and the one after - and then after. after. ***after***. thats how a memecoins **vicious** parabolic moves even come to happen.

ive written another ***even more detailed*** thesis on DOGE/SHIB’s **perp/futures** beginnings - and how that was the main supporting catalyst to their pumps during alt season; and how it would impact CHILLGUYs journey to a mind boggling top no one had seen coming. **the thesis’ basis is all technical and facts based where you could do the same excruciating research and land in the same airport i landed in**. if you guys would like to give it a read ill post it. x
